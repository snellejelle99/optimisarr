# Changelog

## 0.2.15 — 2026-09-25

### Changed

- **The optional Stellar cube icon is now a deep field.** Its three photographic faces are replaced by a generated sky modelled on the Hubble Deep Field: spiral, elliptical, edge-on and irregular galaxies drift past with parallax, over nebula and dust, with temperature-coloured stars. At rest the sky drifts slowly. While work runs, the stars stream into the front corner and a comet traces the outline, then everything settles back to the exact resting frame. The cube now fills its frame, is lit from above with three distinct planes, and picks out its edges in the interface's cyan. The rail and favicons use a simpler drawing with a bold front-corner star that still reads in a 16 px tab. The icon no longer downloads about 380 KB of textures. Settings → System → Appearance keeps an existing Stellar choice, and Precession remains the default.

### Fixed

- Quality-search samples measured on Mac and Windows sidecars no longer score frames at 0. Worker sample measurements were planned without the source's frame rate, so VMAF compared some frames with the frame before them; clean samples on VideoToolbox, NVENC and libx265 alike showed zeros on every scene cut, and searches fell back to the library quality having learned nothing. Samples now use the source's frame rate, and a clip with no known rate is compared frame by frame (#269).
- Final VMAF no longer fails good encodes with near-zero scores. Before each measured window, the server and both sidecars choose a one-frame timing correction; that choice was made with a separate two-second comparison that did not match the real measurement, so it often picked a correction that put the frames one apart. A clean libx265 encode scoring 94–96 was being failed at 21.5. The choice is now made by running the real measurement itself for five seconds at each offset, and the unshifted timing is kept unless another offset is clearly better (#269).
- A delivered worker candidate is verified against the policy frozen when it was claimed, so editing library verification settings while it encodes cannot silently change the result.
- Local, Mac and Windows encodes also check the finished file against their frozen size budget, catching final mux bytes that arrive after the last in-flight poll before quality measurement or upload.
- An implausibly tiny source packet scan is reported as indeterminate when the source video stream's duration agrees with primary audio, even if a failed candidate has no usable output timeline. The original remains protected without falsely diagnosing it as corrupt.
- Full video encodes with a required size reduction stop once their candidate exceeds the source-size budget. Sidecars report this as a terminal size-saving failure, so another worker cannot repeat the doomed encode; the original remains untouched.
- Container and sidecar verification confirm a source picture packet scan once when it ends materially before primary audio, including moderate shortfalls, before attributing a failed timeline to the original.

### Added

- Adaptive VMAF quality samples now forecast the finished file's size before the full encode and hold a predicted size-gate miss for review. Each sample is compared with the source's own video bytes over the same scenes, so busy or quiet sampled minutes no longer skew the estimate, and copied audio and subtitles are counted. A sample that misses the VMAF target and still does not fit ends the search at once, because any quality that passes would be larger. Queue explains the estimate, including how each sampled scene compared, and offers an explicit "Encode anyway" action; approval reruns quality selection on the assigned encoder while final size and quality gates remain intact. This applies to container searches and to Mac and Windows sidecars, which now report bytes for each sample window; older sidecars still get a forecast from their total. Approving a job a worker's samples held no longer counts as that worker handing it back, so the job is offered again at once instead of after the ten-minute handback pause.
- An optional per-library maximum allowed saving for video re-encodes. At 65%, a finished candidate below 35% of the source size fails before final full-file VMAF verification on the container or updated sidecars. The original is retained; blank leaves compression unrestricted. Minimum and maximum targets cannot conflict.
- An optional per-library minimum useful saving for video re-encodes. A 10% target rejects outputs above 90% of the source size; the same frozen limit stops container and sidecar encodes early. Blank keeps the existing any-reduction rule, and compatibility work with size reduction disabled is unaffected.
- Queue job details now show the active and rejected worker attempts as a clear timeline, with each prior verification report one click away. A job with a matching opt-in diagnostic capture can download its bundle directly from the detail view.
- Mac and Windows sidecar tray controls can drain new assignments, finish held work and server acknowledgement, then shut down the host after a visible, cancelable 60-second countdown. Disconnects and unconfirmed lease results block shutdown; the request is not restored after a restart.
- Independent, bounded queue lanes for media jobs, lightweight jobs, strict sidecar evidence checks, and safe replacement. Equal-priority libraries take turns, while Queue shows each lane's capacity, backlog, and wait reason; Settings → Advanced offers automatic or manual limits with an effective-capacity preview. Schedule now explains dispatch gates and each library's window in the same card layout as Libraries.
- Windows Compact Monitor now shows a bounded frame from each active job's locally downloaded source, sampled only while the activity panel is open. Its fallback stays stable for unsupported or audio-only media, and per-job previews clear on completion or disconnect.
- Opt-in diagnostic capture in Settings → System records bounded, structured job transitions and exports a secret-filtered job bundle with attempt, lease and verification summaries. Captures expire or can be stopped; ended evidence is cleaned up after 7 days, or 30 days when it contains a failure.
- Repeatable Playwright UI layout audit across every main page and nested control room, seven viewport/text-size profiles, all nine locales on narrow screens, modal sizing, and card hover/focus behavior, with an optional WebKit pass for Safari rendering.

### Fixed

- Source and candidate packet-timeline scans now read ffprobe output incrementally, avoiding full packet-output buffering on long videos while preserving timestamp and truncated-tail checks.
- Mac and Windows sidecars now animate the Precession cube's internal slices and reactive light when working, using compact antialiased frames from the application's renderer; the tray settles into the exact static mark, respects reduced motion, and stops its timer when idle.
- Verification bounds full-decode errors and decoder threads, stops stalled decode/VMAF processes, and skips repeated full-file measurements once a local candidate fails decode health. Corrupt AV1 outputs remain failed with the original intact instead of driving prolonged verification I/O. The server's VMAF log path is escaped correctly on Windows.
- Verification retries an implausibly short source packet scan once and, if it remains inconsistent with both audio and encoded-video spans, reports the source timeline as indeterminate and retains the original. Server and sidecar timestamp/frame-rate probes select moving video rather than attached artwork. Server, Mac and Windows quality measurements now align each VMAF sample against its own pictures, preventing a shift chosen near the start of a file from corrupting later quality scores.
- Media-server and notification switches now span their Settings cards, advanced library quality controls wrap on small screens, and Dashboard metrics, worker details and the Personal quality check reflow when enlarged text reduces available space. The sidebar language menu stays hidden until it is correctly positioned.
- Complete sidecar verification now defaults on for fresh settings stores; upgrades retain the prior worker-verification choice, and fleet acceptance exercises the strict mode by default.
- Remote verification now uses each worker assignment's frozen colour-conversion plan, preserving SD SMPTE 170M output and reporting source, expected, and output colour tags including range.
- A failed source video timeline now blocks software-decode and higher-quality retries that cannot repair the unchanged original, with the exact gate named in the job failure reason.
- Remote software-decode retries now clear the rejected candidate's active verification and encoder details in one transition, preserve its checks as attempt history, and show the retry reason and worker handoff in Queue.
- AV1 NVENC video re-encodes omit attached-picture streams that can corrupt the primary AV1 output, and use FFmpeg's default timestamps for constant-rate sources to avoid duplicate DTS values.

## 0.2.14 — 2026-09-19

### Added

- Published the Windows code-signing policy, including the exact artifacts eligible for signing,
  trusted-build and approval controls, privacy and network-transfer details, user verification,
  incident response, and the boundary between pending SignPath support and current unsigned previews.

### Changed

- **The Precession cube is now the default icon everywhere.** New browser sessions use its
  sliced, activity-driven cube and matching favicon; Stellar remains available in Settings →
  System → Appearance and an existing saved choice is preserved. The Mac menu-bar app, Finder,
  Windows tray, executable, Start shortcut and installer now use the same Precession artwork.
- Mac and Windows sidecar tray icons now rotate while their worker is handling a job, settle back
  to the exact application mark when work stops, and stay still when reduced motion is enabled.
- The README header now shows the real working Precession motion, with light-theme and
  reduced-motion variants rather than a separate illustration.

## 0.2.13 — 2026-09-17

### Added

- Coordinated container and native download releases use the shared application version,
  validate release tags, and hold packages in draft until validation is complete.
- Updated setup, worker, verification, API and native-client documentation, including
  a dedicated worker-placement guide and the current Stellar icon in the README.

- Compact Monitor for the Windows tray, with live worker status, resource readings, processing
  details, pause/resume and nested preferences. Work remains in the background service. An
  unsigned MSI preview bundles the tray, worker, media tools and private runtimes, with a guard
  against overwriting manually installed workers.
- The Mac menu-bar client shares the compact layout, textured cards and hover shadows, retaining
  native media previews and work settings. Preferences and diagnostics stay inside the panel;
  pausing lets held jobs finish and prevents new claims, including a request already in flight.

- Repeatable media acceptance harness for isolated containers and disposable macOS/Windows
  workers, with pinned Creative Commons film excerpts, independent VMAF/SSIM/audio checks,
  transfer fault tests, replacement/rollback validation, and HTML/JSON/JUnit evidence. Final-image
  CI now runs real application workflows before publishing an image. See
  [the harness guide](docs/development/media-acceptance.md) for scope and hardware requirements.

- Optional strict sidecar-only verification for remote video jobs. When enabled, a protocol-2
  worker receives a lease-bound contract, performs probes, decode-health, timestamp and audio
  checks beside its FFmpeg tools, and returns immutable evidence bound to both file hashes. The
  server evaluates that evidence and never runs a media verification fallback for the lease.

### Fixed

- Keep sidecar popovers attached to the menu bar or taskbar when details and preferences change size; retain rounded corners and dismiss behind other apps.
- Use the current Stellar icon in both native clients, including Finder, the Windows tray, Start menu and installer. Windows development MSIs can update an installed preview with the same application version.

- Existing sidecar pairings renegotiate protocol support on heartbeat after an upgrade. Strict
  verification rejects incomplete measurements and stores the first report atomically, including
  concurrent retries. Mac decode checks distinguish harmless muxer timing notes from corruption.
- The Mac media bundle includes AV1 decoding and 10/12-bit x265 support, with a bundle check that
  verifies decoding and bit-depth support rather than relying on encoder names alone.

- Software-decode retries recreate and reserve their output directory after rejected candidates
  are cleaned up, preventing an otherwise valid retry from failing with a missing-directory error.

- Readiness checks now honour configured work and quarantine directories.
- Finished remote jobs retain the worker name that delivered their output.
- Short previews verify against the available source duration instead of requiring 60 seconds.
- Worker VMAF plans include the freshly probed source cadence, keeping variable-frame-rate
  measurements consistent with local verification.
- A worker releasing its lease after cancellation no longer puts the cancelled job back on the queue.

### Changed

- **The Stellar cube has softer, consistent lighting.** Its moving shadow now fades
  naturally instead of appearing as a hard grey platform when Canvas filters are
  unavailable. Gentler star-field toning, a subtle halo and tighter sidebar spacing
  carry through light/dark themes, reduced-motion stills and favicons.

- **Setup now follows the current application theme from start to finish.** Theme and
  language controls are available during onboarding, with clearer status colours,
  keyboard focus and a mobile-friendly folder picker. Failed checks can be retried,
  invalid job limits are caught before review, and saved library automation is shown
  accurately when setup is restarted. Completing setup opens its destination reliably
  while preserving the reviewed plan across refreshes.

- **Stellar cube is the default application icon.** Three drifting star fields, soft glow,
  moving light and a projected shadow stay calm at rest; active work adds gentle precession
  and occasional inward/outward depth changes before smoothly settling. Favicons and
  reduced-motion stills match the selected theme and activity. The original sliced
  Precession cube remains available in Settings → System → Appearance; the choice is
  saved in this browser.

- Quarantine comparisons now open a dedicated review page with breadcrumbs, direct links,
  full-width playback and verification cards. Returning to the list restores its scroll
  position and keyboard focus. Approve and rollback retain their confirmations; finished
  entries show read-only history.

- Queue artwork stays visible through live updates and refreshes. Loaded posters and
  missing-artwork placeholders now retain their state until the media item changes.
- **The optional Precession icon is a cube balanced on its tip.** Fifteen slices twist in sequence
  while Optimisarr is working, then settle into a seamless cube. At rest, a slowly moving
  light shifts the highlights and shadow. Light and dark themes have matching colours and
  favicons; reduced motion keeps a still image, and hidden icons stop animating.

- **Library configuration follows the processing workflow.** Choose files, Encode, Verify,
  and Schedule & replace open focused pages with breadcrumbs and browser Back support.
  Specialist encoding, audio, image, eligibility and verification controls have their own
  advanced pages; custom settings remain visible in the overview. Drafts are saved together,
  and validation links return to the setting that needs attention. Named preset choices,
  explanatory tooltips and the shared card textures, shadows and hover lift keep the editor
  readable on desktop and mobile. Child pages retain the shared content width and
  light/dark surfaces, with form labels and control spacing aligned with Settings.
- **Queue now separates working jobs from what is next.** A poster-led working card shows
  progress and processing stages; other running jobs remain visible beneath it. Job details
  open in a poster-led dialog with verification evidence, captured commands and the existing job actions.
  Filtering recent and waiting jobs keeps running work visible, including remote workers.
- Opening a job anywhere in a long queue now shows its details in the viewport without
  scrolling the list. The dialog keeps its close button and actions visible while details
  scroll. Escape, backdrop dismissal and Close return focus to the selected row; live
  progress and completion continue updating while it is open.
- Settings rooms and their child pages now use the same content width as Libraries. Cards
  regain the shared surface gradient and colour, with hover lift and a deeper drop shadow
  on the room links. System sections keep their spacing at smaller widths.
- Queue refreshes no longer overwrite newer progress received during the request. Confirmed
  local suspension is distinguished from remote work, and unfinished encodes stay below
  100% in both the Queue and sidebar. Job action failures remain visible across refreshes.
- Cached posters initialise before rendering so a successful image load is not hidden by
  a later reset of the loading state.

- **Inventory now uses the Index layout.** A calmer file list puts artwork, size, format
  and the rule verdict together. Opening a file shows a poster-led dialog with its library,
  metadata, full path and eligibility reason, plus reachable Probe and Preview actions.
  Missing artwork falls back quietly; phone layouts keep the details scrollable.
- Preview comparisons now use the application theme and native modal focus handling.
  Minimising lets you continue browsing; opening another file's preview replaces the previous
  comparison. Closing a preview before it finishes starting now cleans up the late job too.
- Rapid inventory filter changes no longer allow an older response to replace the current
  results. Empty filters stay usable, and probe errors appear alongside the selected file.
- Sidebar footer controls remain reachable in short windows while a job is active, and
  artwork recovers when a job without a poster is followed by one with artwork.

- **Settings now uses the Control rooms layout.** Processing and protection sit above
  connections and system tools, with clearer room icons, complete state summaries and more
  breathing room. Encoding controls have aligned labels and short explanations; drafts stay
  intact between rooms, and returning to the overview restores keyboard focus. System
  sections have consistent spacing, and encoder tiles reflow without squeezing together.
- The sidebar language menu now keeps its full width instead of collapsing to the globe
  button’s width. It stays within the viewport in both expanded and collapsed sidebars.

- The desktop sidebar and page tray now have 16 px of space above and below them. Mobile
  safe-area padding previously overrode the desktop spacing and left both flush with the
  window; the mobile drawer still fills the screen.


- **The sidebar is an island, and it says what is encoding.** The rail no longer runs the
  full height of the window as a wall the page leans against: at desktop widths it is a raised
  card floating on the ground, and the page sits in a recessed tray beside it, so the two are
  read as objects on a surface rather than as regions of one. Beneath the navigation, while
  work is running, a card names the job being encoded — artwork, title, where it is running,
  the encoder, a progress bar, the percentage, the speed, how long is left and how many are
  queued behind it — and opens the Queue. The mark above it already turned while work ran;
  now the rail says what the work is, whichever page is open. The version and build move up
  under the name, and the foot becomes three buttons: theme, language and collapse. On a
  phone the rail is still a drawer and the page still takes the whole screen.

- **The theme lives in one place, and both colour schemes are drawn from it.** Every
  component used to spell out its own light and dark colours side by side — around fifteen
  hundred hand-paired classes — so a palette change meant touching all of them, and the two
  schemes drifted: dark-only captions were never adjusted, and the login screen, the phone
  header and the table headers each sat on a colour that no card used. The stylesheet now
  defines an ink scale (headline to ghost), a surface set (ground, panel, raised, sunken, lit)
  and five tones (ok, warn, bad, live, info), and components say `text-ink-3` or `tone-warn`
  and let the scheme decide; a unit test keeps hand-paired colours at zero. Alongside that:
  the dark ground is lifted a step off pure black with a faint bloom from where the mark is,
  so a panel's lift can actually be seen; badges, chips, notices and toned cards share one
  set of tints, so "failed" is the same red wherever it is said; notices lose their coloured
  borders and the setup checklist its coloured left stripes in favour of tinted fills; every
  pressable thing gets the same focus ring; switches are a well with a raised knob; tooltips,
  table headers, scrollbars and text selection are themed; figures are tabular everywhere;
  and the browser's own chrome takes the page colour and follows the theme toggle.

- **Settings is a set of rooms instead of a strip of tabs.** The page had inherited the setup
  wizard's furniture: numbered sections that implied an order nobody follows, a save button
  that covered some of the page with a caption explaining which parts it missed, and no way to
  tell which of forty-odd controls you had moved off its default. It now opens on a grid of
  cards, one per section, and each card reports what that section is currently set to — which
  media servers are connected, what the encoder resolves to, how long originals are kept — so
  the common questions are answered without opening anything. Opening a card gives that section
  the page to itself at its own URL, so `/settings/encoding` is a link you can send someone.
  Everything you change is a draft until you press Save: changed values light up, say what they
  were, and can be put back one at a time, and the save bar counts what it is about to write.
  The draft follows you between rooms, and leaving Settings with unsaved work asks first.
  Read-only diagnostics stop pretending to be settings — tools, hardware acceleration, encoder
  probes and configuration backup are gathered into a System room that is marked read-only.
  Minimum free disk moved from the queue section to Files & safety, where the rest of the
  refuses-to-start rules live.

- **The interface is built from surfaces now, not from boxes with lines round them.** Every
  panel in the app wore the same one-pixel border, which gave a reader nothing to go on: a
  card, a header band and a table row all announced themselves equally loudly. A surface is
  now a soft gradient fill, a layered shadow and a single hairline of light along its top
  edge — the way a raised object actually looks — and lines survive only where they divide
  content inside a surface. Controls follow the same logic: buttons are raised because you
  press them, inputs and progress tracks are recessed because you put something into them.
  Cards you can open lift slightly under the pointer. The light theme's page colour moved a
  shade deeper to make room for it, because a white card cannot lift off a white page.
  Selecting a processing mode, a quality strategy or a codec now lights that card's fill
  rather than drawing a coloured ring around it, which keeps selection reading as "this one
  is on" rather than "this one has been ringed".

- **The application mark is drawn, and it reports the server's state.** The logo was a static
  picture that told you which application you already had open. It is now a four-dimensional
  hypercube rasterised onto a pixel grid — sixteen vertices and thirty-two edges, turned by real
  rotation matrices and projected through two perspective divides, with a depth buffer so near
  edges occlude far ones. The light is volumetric rather than a lamp the structure ignores: it
  fills the lattice from the centre, and every bar it crosses on the way out takes a share of
  it, so the cube prints its own shadows and the light carries past the shell only where the
  frame left a gap. It turns quickly with a lit core while work is running and settles to a
  slow, dim drift when the queue goes quiet, crossing between the two over about a second and
  a half, so the icon slowing down is itself the signal that the queue emptied. The favicon is
  the same mark, so a background tab answers "is it still going?" without being opened. It is
  drawn for the theme it is sitting on, keeps a transparent background, and holds its resting
  pose for anyone who has asked for reduced motion. It sits above the wordmark at the size the
  old logo was, with the name riding up over its foot — the mark's lower corner is empty space,
  so the overlap closes a gap the bounding box left rather than covering anything.

- **The dashboard says what is happening, and why it is not.** The page drew the same screen
  whether the queue was racing or wedged: every figure on it was a count and none of them was a
  state, so "0 running, 1,418 queued" was what you got when the optimise window was shut, when
  media was streaming, when the operator had paused, and when nothing was eligible. A status bar
  now names the state, and when the state is not encoding it names the gate in the server's own
  words. Below it the three things you previously had to open two other pages to learn: what is
  being worked on, which machines are doing it, and what is waiting on a decision from you.
  Failures are grouped by cause rather than counted, because "144 failed" says nothing you can
  act on. The live CPU and GPU graph is gone — it was a copy of the one on Queue, two flat lines
  on an idle server, and the fleet list now carries the same figure per machine, which the single
  graph could not once workers existed. The lifetime savings figure stays, demoted from a hero to
  one cell of four.
- **The navigation carries a number where a number is worth carrying.** The queue while it has
  work, and quarantine while originals are waiting on a decision — nothing else. A count beside
  every entry is seven figures competing for attention and five that never change, which leaves
  a reader no wiser about which one they were meant to look at. A figure that is zero, or that
  has not been fetched yet, is absent rather than shown as a nought. The rows are roomier, the
  entry you are on is a soft filled key, and the three strips that used to sit stacked at the
  foot — each with its own rule across the rail — are one. The running version and the build it
  came from stay where they were: they are the first thing anyone is asked for when something
  looks wrong.

- **The macOS sidecar's panel is a readout.** It was a stack of rounded cards that happened to
  carry figures, with the hierarchy coming from fill and radius rather than from the content. The
  panel now states the machine's identity and its state opposite each other in a bar across the
  top, runs everything it knows about itself down one column of monospaced, tabular figures that
  can be compared vertically, and puts the controls along the bottom where they cannot be mistaken
  for readings. Progress is lit segments rather than a filled bar, so a glance takes a level off it
  without reading the figure beside it — and during an encode there is no bar at all, because the
  worker knows how many seconds it has done and not how many it owes, and a bar that guessed would
  be a lie in the one place the panel exists to be honest. Every colour now comes from the web
  interface's own tokens: Tailwind slate for the neutrals and cyan for the single accent, in both
  appearances, so a fault on this panel is the same colour as the same fault on the dashboard.

### Fixed

- **The menu-bar mark no longer turns on an idle Mac.** The timer behind it also feeds the load
  meters, which were made to run whenever the panel is open so an idle machine still shows what it
  is doing — and that set the mark turning with them. It looked busy for exactly as long as
  somebody was looking at it, which is the one moment the mark has to be honest. It now turns only
  while a job is actually running.
- **The macOS sidecar's panel stays against the menu bar.** Once a Mac had run a job and gone
  quiet, its panel hung below the menu bar with a gap above it, the size of the film strip that was
  no longer there. A menu-bar window keeps the height its tallest content needed, and SwiftUI
  centres a shorter view inside it — so the panel drifted down by half the space it had given back.
  A spacer beneath the content could not fix that, because the stack is sized to its own content
  and never sees the spare height; the panel now fills whatever height the window has and stays at
  the top of it.
- **The candidate is lined up against the source by measuring, not by arithmetic.** Encodes that
  were perfectly good were being failed at a harmonic mean of 0.21 when they actually score 92.
  A sampled comparison pairs pictures by time, so the candidate's offset from the source has to be
  removed first — and that offset was derived from the containers' own headers, as the video
  stream's start less the container's. Those two are equal in every real container, so the
  correction computed as zero for every file either sidecar has ever measured and was never once
  applied. It could not have helped anyway: two episodes of the same show, encoded by the same
  command on the same machine, are identical in every header field and need opposite answers —
  one scores 0.21 without a one-frame correction and 92.32 with it, the other 89.88 without and
  0.31 with. The difference is that frames are still occasionally lost in an encode, so whether a
  window lines up depends on how many went missing before it, which no header can say. All three
  machines now try the candidate a frame either way against a two-second window and keep whichever
  matched, which costs about a second and is the same probe on the server and both sidecars.
- **A finished candidate is no longer thrown away because the server is restarting.** A worker
  that had encoded a file, measured it and had its evidence accepted lost the lot to
  `Delivering the candidate failed (HTTP 502)` — a deployment had restarted the container while the
  bytes were going up, and the job went back on the queue to be done again from nothing. Delivery
  has always been resumable, since the server reports how much of the candidate it holds, so a
  blink should cost a pause; but only a narrow set of errors was being retried, and a 502 from a
  proxy in front of a restarting container was not among them. Worse on Windows, where the question
  "how much do you hold?" answered **zero** when it could not be asked at all — the same answer as
  a server that genuinely holds nothing — which would have sent a delivery back to the beginning
  and re-sent every byte. It now says it could not ask, and is retried like everything else. The
  bound is unchanged and stays where it belongs: the lease's own renewal loop gives the job up once
  no renewal has landed for as long as the server granted the lease for.
- **A repeated message is not a decode error.** Twenty-four good encodes were thrown away on a
  line that describes no fault at all. FFmpeg collapses consecutive identical messages into
  `Last message repeated N times`, and the decode-health gate counted that notice as a corrupt
  frame. The cruelty of it is which message was being repeated: the muxer's "non monotonically
  increasing dts" remark, which this gate already knows to ignore, and which hardware encoders emit
  routinely. So the ignored line was printed, FFmpeg noted it had repeated, and the note — not the
  line — failed the job: `1 decode error(s): Last message repeated 1 times`. The notice is now read
  as what it is, an account of how many of the previous message there were: a repeat of an ignored
  line is ignored with it, a repeat of a real error counts as the errors it stands for rather than
  as one, and a repeat with nothing before it counts nothing.
- **The dashboard no longer downloads the entire job history to find the three jobs that are
  running.** It asked for every job and sifted the result in the browser; on the library this was
  checked against that is 1,773 records, re-fetched every fifteen seconds. It now asks the server
  for the jobs with work outstanding.
- **A worker holding one job says "1 job".** It said "1 jobs", and the version that followed it
  lost the space before its separator. The same missing space was in the navigation's
  running/queued figure, which read "3/ 14".
- **The in-flight list no longer runs off the page.** It drew every outstanding job, and a real
  server carries a dozen or more — thirteen on the one this was checked against — which pushed
  everything below it off the screen. It shows the first six and says how many more there are.


### Fixed

- **The Windows sidecar says what each measured window scored.** A candidate measured on PICARD
  came back with a mean of 80.6 and a harmonic mean of 37.1 — a window full of zero-scoring frames
  beside a respectable average, which is the signature of two timelines misaligned rather than of a
  bad encode — and nothing in the log said which of its three windows had gone wrong. It now
  reports the frame count, mean, harmonic mean, lowest frame and how many scored near zero for
  every window, during the quality search as well as the final measurement, in the same words the
  macOS sidecar has used since that bug was first found there. The scratch directory goes on every
  exit path, so this is the only account of a measurement that survives the job.
- **An encode keeps every frame the source had.** Whole seasons were failing verification with
  harmonic means in single figures and a fifth percentile of zero, and the encodes were fine: FFmpeg
  was silently dropping frames. Its default frame-rate handling drops frames whose timestamps
  collide, and it does that on sources ffprobe is perfectly happy to call constant — a VC-1 WEBRip
  declaring 25/1 for both its average and real frame rates lost eight frames in its first two
  hundred seconds, about fifty an episode, gone from the library without a word. It also made the
  encode unmeasurable, which is how it was found: once the candidate holds fewer frames than the
  source, frame N of one is no longer frame N of the other and every windowed comparison comes
  apart. The same pair scored a harmonic mean of 9.4 against the source and 81 against a reference
  cut the same lossy way. The rule already existed for sources ffprobe had positively identified as
  variable; the dangerous source is the one that looks regular and is not, so it can no longer be
  conditional on having noticed. A frame-rate cap still takes over the cadence, and a remux still
  copies the stream untouched.
- **A job on the macOS sidecar ends when its process does.** A Mac sat in "Measuring" for fifty-two
  minutes with no FFmpeg running at all — lease renewing perfectly, menu bar animating, check-in
  loop answering every ten seconds, and the job never moving. The transcode runner treated
  end-of-file on the child's standard output as the child ending, but a pipe is only at its end when
  the last handle on its write side closes, and a pipe macOS creates is inherited by anything the
  app spawns while it is open: a load probe, a preview frame, another job's FFmpeg. Nothing could
  recover from it, because every part that might have noticed was working correctly. The pipes are
  now kept out of other children, and the process's exit — not the pipe — decides when a job is
  over. The same call was in the capability prober and the frame grabber, which would have hung the
  same way.
- **The Windows sidecar no longer waits on a pipe either.** It waited for the exit, which was right,
  and then read the tail of FFmpeg's diagnostics to the end, which could outlive it for the same
  reason. The exit is now the authority there too; the pipes are given two seconds to hand over
  what they still hold and no vote on whether the job is finished.
- **A moment's silence from the server no longer throws away an encode.** Both sidecars renew their
  lease every few seconds while a job runs, and a single refused renewal ended the loop and
  abandoned the work — so restarting the container, which happens on every deployment, discarded
  every encode running at that moment, minutes in, and the job went back to the queue to start
  again. Worse, every renewal failure was treated as final, including a 502 from a proxy in front of
  a container that was still coming up. A lease is now only given up when the server says it is gone
  — it lapsed, it belongs to another worker, the credential was refused — or when no renewal has
  landed for as long as the server granted the lease for. A lease the server really has reassigned
  still stops the encode at once.
- **The macOS sidecar's panel no longer hangs away from the menu bar.** Once a Mac had run a job
  and gone quiet, its panel sat detached below the menu bar with a gap above it — roughly the
  height of the film strip that was no longer there, which is exactly what it was: the window keeps
  the height its tallest content needed and the content settles at the bottom of it. The panel now
  takes the top of whatever height the window has. The machine-load card also stays on when idle
  rather than vanishing with the job, because an idle Mac still has a figure worth seeing and the
  panel no longer collapses to a single line the moment a job ends.
- **A worker that is plainly working is no longer marked offline.** Liveness was judged on check-ins
  alone, so a machine in the middle of a long job could be declared offline while it was renewing
  its lease every few seconds. Any authenticated request now counts as proof of life.
- **The Windows sidecar checks in while it works.** Jobs ran inside the check-in loop, so the server
  heard nothing from a busy worker until whatever it was doing finished. They now run beside it, and
  a stopping service drains them rather than cutting them off.
- **A library that prefers a worker now actually sends it work.** Setting every library to prefer a
  sidecar changed nothing, for a reason no setting made visible: a worker cannot be offered a job
  until a per-title quality has been chosen for it, that search runs on the server, and the server
  ran the encode straight afterwards. The job was unofferable right up to the moment the server
  started encoding it, so the preference had no instant at which it could apply. The search is the
  server's decision and stays there; the encode that follows is now handed back to the queue when a
  worker could take it, which is the point at which the preference finally means something. A job
  still awaiting its quality is no longer held for a worker either, since holding it was waiting for
  something that could not happen.
- **The queue says why nothing is running.** Ninety jobs queued, nothing running, nothing paused and
  no waiting reason was indistinguishable from a dispatcher that had stopped — every gate was
  reasonable and none of them said anything. It now reports, once a cycle, how many jobs were inside
  their window, how many this machine may run, how many were held for a worker, and whether media is
  streaming.

- **"Prefer a worker" now actually prefers one.** A library set to prefer a sidecar was still having
  every job run on the server. The preference gives a worker first refusal for a few minutes, and
  that clock ran from the moment a job was enqueued — but a library with an optimise window enqueues
  its work hours before the window opens, so the head start expired while the job sat ineligible to
  run at all. The instant the window opened, the server was free to take the entire backlog, and
  did. The hold now starts when a job first becomes runnable, which is what it always meant.
- **The queue shows how far the quality search has got.** A job selecting a per-title quality
  reports real progress, and the preview screen has always shown it, but the queue drew a sliding
  bar that said nothing — the progress bar was gated on the verification stage alone. The hero, the
  rows and the detail panel now show the percentage, and say "Selecting quality" rather than
  "Probing source" once it is measuring candidates, because by then it is no longer reading the
  source.
- **The Windows test-host guide now works when you follow it.** Provisioning a machine from
  `sidecars/windows/docs/test-host-setup.md` failed at seven separate points, several of them
  silently. Installing PowerShell the way it said produced a per-user alias rather than
  `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`, so sshd fell back to `cmd.exe` — the one thing that step
  exists to prevent. The OpenSSH capability needs a reboot before its service exists, so the
  commands that started and configured it could not have worked, and even after a reboot the service
  comes back set to start manually. In the distro, editing the SSH port did nothing because Ubuntu
  24.04 socket-activates ssh, leaving the host on port 22 with no error to say so; the port-forward
  command never expanded its own argument; and `sudo` prompted for a password no script could
  supply. The guide now carries what actually works, including why mirrored WSL networking removes
  the port-forward entirely, and how to reach the distro from a machine with nobody logged in.

### Added

- **The Workers tab shows how busy each machine is.** A remote worker was a black box: it either
  took a job or it did not, and there was no way to see whether the Mac in the other room was
  saturated, idle, or sharing its CPU with something else. Sidecars now report CPU and GPU load
  with every check-in, and every few seconds while a job runs, so the figure beside a running
  encode is current rather than a check-in old. A worker that cannot measure itself reports
  nothing and is shown as reporting nothing, because "idle" and "no answer" are different answers
  to give someone deciding where work should go. GPU is labelled as utilisation only: a hardware
  encode can run on a media engine that reports nothing at all, so the number reads low while the
  machine is flat out.

### Fixed

- **The macOS sidecar no longer freezes on launch behind a Keychain prompt nobody can see.** An
  upgrade that changed the app's signature left the stored credential unreadable, and the read that
  found this out blocked the main thread waiting on a dialog — so the app started and then stopped
  responding, with no window and no Dock icon to show for it, and nothing in the log. Two guards
  meant to prevent exactly this did not work: the code suppressed Keychain interaction with an
  `LAContext`, which governs the data protection keychain and has no bearing on the legacy
  keychain's dialog, and it deferred the read into a task that was already on the main actor and so
  blocked identically. The read now happens off the main actor with the legacy dialog properly
  suppressed, an unreadable item is discarded as it was always meant to be, and the app says in its
  log what it found.

### Added

- **The macOS sidecar can be paired from a terminal.** `--pair <server>` reads a PIN from standard
  input, pairs, and exits — so a Mac can be set up over SSH, scripted onto several machines, or
  recovered remotely when a pairing is lost, none of which was possible when the pairing sheet was
  the only way in. The PIN comes from stdin rather than an argument so it never reaches `ps` or a
  shell history.

- **The Workers tab shows which build each sidecar is running.** Until now the only version on
  screen was the protocol version, which says what the two ends agreed to speak and nothing about
  what is installed — so a Mac quietly ran a build two commits behind the fix it needed, and
  nothing on the page could have told you. A sidecar now reports its own version and build number
  on pairing and on every check-in, since upgrading it does not re-pair it. A worker that reports
  nothing is shown as reporting nothing rather than being assumed current.
- **A Windows sidecar has begun, starting with capability probing.** A Windows machine will
  contribute spare encoding capacity the way a Mac does, as a service so it works with nobody logged
  in, with a tray application as its window onto that service. The first piece is the part worth
  getting right before anything else: every encoder, hardware decoder and VMAF backend is proved by
  running it, never read from FFmpeg's listing, because a build lists NVENC on a machine with no
  NVIDIA card. NVIDIA hardware VMAF is scored for real, since the server sends a GPU measurement
  command on the strength of that answer alone.
- **An orphaned sidecar can be removed from the Workers tab.** Revoking keeps the record, which is
  right for a worker turned off deliberately, but pairing the same machine again left the old entry
  on the list for ever with nothing that cleared it. Remove deletes the record and its lease
  history. It is offered only for a worker that is revoked or offline, and refused outright while
  one is still holding a job, since removing it mid-job would strand the work.
- **The sidecar says what it is working on and how fast.** A running job is named by its file
  rather than a job number, which answered the question nobody was asking, and the two transfer
  stages show a smoothed rate beside the byte counts. The header line names the real stage, so a
  source still downloading no longer reads as "Encoding".
- **The macOS sidecar has an Options panel, and work can be moved off the startup disk.** A job's
  source and candidate can go in the app's own folder, in a folder you choose, or on a RAM disk
  created for that job and destroyed when it ends. A job needing more working space than the memory
  budget runs on disk instead of being refused, because losing work to a preference would be worse
  than ignoring the preference. The budget defaults to a quarter of installed memory and is
  adjustable between a twentieth and a half. Stray RAM disks from a crash are swept at launch.
- **The macOS sidecar can encode AV1, and decode it in hardware.** SVT-AV1 is bundled, so a
  library targeting AV1 can now run on a Mac; the server already named `libsvtav1` for a software
  AV1 target, so nothing on the server side changed. Apple ships no AV1 encoder in VideoToolbox on
  any Apple Silicon, M5 included, so AV1 encoding is on the CPU. Decoding AV1 is a hardware path
  the chip does have, and FFmpeg 8.0 is the first release carrying the VideoToolbox AV1 hwaccel, so
  the pinned FFmpeg moves from 7.1.2 to 8.0.3. That release also carries the x265 build guard 7.1.2
  was pinned for.
- **The macOS sidecar ships as a disk image you install by dragging.** A release now produces a
  signed, notarised and stapled `.dmg` alongside the zip, opening with the app beside a shortcut to
  Applications. A zip leaves the app wherever the browser put it, and a menu-bar app living in
  Downloads is one tidy-up away from disappearing. The app also has an icon at last, generated from
  the same mark the web app uses, instead of Finder's blank placeholder.
- **The macOS sidecar can be built as a notarised, distributable app.** `release-app.sh` signs
  with a Developer ID, archives with `ditto`, submits to Apple, staples the ticket to the bundle and
  checks the result the way Gatekeeper will; a `sidecar-v*` tag does the same in CI and attaches the
  zip to the Release, caching the hour-long FFmpeg build against the tags it pins. The app also
  carries a real version instead of a hardcoded 0.1.0.
- **The macOS sidecar's menu shows what this Mac is actually doing.** A running job gets a
  time-lapse of the frames going through the encoder, with a strip beneath showing the run, and a
  real progress bar for the two stages that have one: bytes received while a source downloads and
  bytes sent while a candidate is delivered. A GPU reading sits alongside, stating plainly that
  VideoToolbox encodes on the media engine that macOS does not report. Frames and GPU are sampled
  only while the menu is open. The menu itself is grouped into cards with a status colour carried
  from the header, and `--render-menu` writes a picture of every state so a layout change can be
  reviewed without a paired server and a running job.
- **A dropped source download resumes instead of starting a multi-gigabyte file again.** The macOS
  sidecar fetches sources in bounded 64 MB byte ranges, keeps every complete range across transient
  failures, and asks for the next missing byte. It validates each `Content-Range`, requires the
  source hash on every response, and still hashes the assembled source before ffmpeg sees it. A
  server that predates ranged delivery can return the whole file as before.
- **A remote job keeps its lease during every long-running stage.** Renewal used to run only beside
  ffmpeg, leaving a slow source download or candidate upload able to outlive its lease. Fetching,
  encoding, VMAF measurement, and delivery now all renew with their current stage; if renewal says
  the lease is gone, the in-flight transfer or process is cancelled immediately.
- **The macOS sidecar has its own CI gate.** Pull requests and protected-branch pushes now run the
  Swift protocol/lifecycle suite and a release build on an Apple Silicon macOS runner, so this
  separately versioned client can no longer regress while the Linux backend and web jobs stay green.
- **The macOS sidecar rechecks free scratch space before it downloads a claimed source.** The
  server already considers reported capacity while assigning work, but free space can change
  between a heartbeat and a claim, especially with several jobs at once. The runner now measures
  the actual work volume immediately before transfer and hands back a job that cannot still hold
  its source plus candidate allowance; an unreadable capacity fails closed before any media moves.
  Every heartbeat also refreshes that same work-volume capacity instead of repeating the value
  measured at launch, so a low-space Mac stops being offered work rather than repeatedly refusing it.
- **A library can say where its work may run once remote workers are on.** Advanced options gain
  **Where this library's work may run**, shown only while remote workers are switched on and the
  preview flag is present: *Here or on a worker* (the default, and what every existing library
  upgrades to), *Only on this server*, *Prefer a worker* (held for an online, non-draining worker
  for up to ten minutes, then this server takes it), and *Only on workers*. The choice is a filter
  over the one shared queue, never a second queue: a job keeps its priority and age wherever it is
  allowed to run, the local dispatcher and a worker's claim honour the same rule from
  `WorkPlacementPolicy`, and a library kept on this server is never offered to a worker, neither
  by the cheap pre-filter nor by full preparation. While remote workers are off every placement
  runs here, so a library set to *Only on workers* cannot stall for a feature not in use; the
  editor says so in one line when it is hiding a non-default choice for that reason. Adaptive
  per-title VMAF libraries still run here whatever the choice says, and the editor says that too.
  New `workPlacement` on the library API and in config backups (an older backup restores as
  *Here or on a worker*); migration `AddLibraryWorkPlacement`.
- **A remote worker can be drained.** `POST /api/workers/{id}/drain` asks a worker to finish what
  it holds and take no more: its leases still renew and deliver, the claim route offers it nothing,
  the local dispatcher stops counting it as a worker a *Prefer a worker* library could wait for,
  and its heartbeat response says `draining` so the sidecar can show it. `DELETE
  /api/workers/{id}/drain` resumes it, and refuses a revoked worker with `409` because only
  pairing again brings one back. `GET /api/workers` gains `drainRequestedAt` and `heldLeases`, the
  jobs a drain is waiting on. Migration `AddWorkerDrain`.
- **The Workers tab shows what each machine is doing.** Each paired sidecar is now a card:
  status (Online, Draining, Drained, Offline, Revoked), what it proved it can do, what it is working
  on with a stage and a progress bar, its load and free scratch, when it was last seen, and its last
  problem. **Drain after this job**, **Resume taking work** and **Revoke** sit on the card. Progress
  comes from the sidecar's lease renewals, which now carry the stage and ffmpeg's encoded seconds
  (and happen at least every fifteen seconds while encoding); the server scales the seconds
  against the source duration, so the queue row and the card move from one number. "Last problem"
  is written by the server where it refuses or discards something the worker did — a lapsed lease,
  a candidate encoded from the wrong source or with the wrong hash, a delivered candidate that
  failed verification — because the worker itself never learns of those. Migration
  `AddWorkerActivity`; the macOS sidecar sends the new renewal body.
- **A queue row says where a remote job is.** A leased job reads "encoding on Mac Studio…" with
  the worker's own progress bar (or "sending the source…", "returning the candidate…"), a
  delivered one "returned from Mac Studio · waiting to be verified", and the "Now" card names the
  machine instead of showing this server's CPU and GPU graphs for work it is not doing. A queued
  job its library keeps off this server reads "waiting for a worker…", judged by the dispatcher's
  own rule so the row never says waiting for a job the server would start. `GET /api/jobs` gains
  `workerName`, `remoteStage` and `waitingForWorker`.
- **A remote worker measures VMAF, and the server decides whether to believe it.** An assignment
  now carries the server's own libvmaf command for each measurement window, with placeholders for
  the worker's paths, fixed at claim and recorded on the lease. The macOS sidecar runs them after
  its encode and posts the raw JSON logs with both hashes to `POST
  /api/workers/leases/{id}/quality` before delivering the candidate; the server parses and pools
  the logs with the same code that reads a local measurement. At verification the evidence stands
  in for this server's VMAF pass, roughly half the cost of verifying, only when it is bound to the
  delivered candidate's hash and to a policy at least as strict as the library requires now.
  Otherwise the server measures VMAF itself and writes why on the worker's card. Every other gate
  is still repeated here, and a low score fails the candidate the ordinary way. New stage
  `Measuring`; migration `AddLeaseQualityEvidence`.
- **The macOS sidecar survives a lid and a quit.** While a job runs it holds a system activity
  assertion, so macOS neither naps the app nor idles the machine to sleep under an encode. When
  the Mac sleeps anyway the job is handed back first and the server reassigns it at once, rather
  than two minutes later when the lease lapses; check-ins resume on wake. Quitting the app
  mid-job hands the job back before exiting. The menu gains **Start at login**, registered
  through the system's login-item service.
- **A remote worker decodes in hardware when it proved it can.** A worker that proved
  VideoToolbox decode by a real decode is sent a command that decodes with it, for VideoToolbox
  encodes, with the frames left in system memory so every software filter still applies; the
  claim requires the proved decoder and the lease records it. A delivered candidate that fails
  verification with the signature of decoder corruption is not failed: the job is requeued to
  decode in software wherever it runs next, and the worker's card says why. Migration
  `AddDecodeFacts`.
- **A candidate can be delivered in resumable chunks.** `GET …/result/offset`, `PATCH …/result`
  with `X-Optimisarr-Offset`, and `POST …/result/complete` let a worker append a multi-gigabyte
  candidate 64 MB at a time and, after a dropped connection, ask where it got to and carry on;
  the assembled file is hashed and judged exactly as a whole upload, and the staging file is
  named by lease so a resumed upload can only continue its own transfer. The macOS sidecar
  delivers this way when the server offers it and in one piece otherwise.
- **The macOS sidecar runs more than one job at once, and works again after a relaunch.**
  **Jobs at once** in the menu chooses one to four parallel jobs; the choice is persisted,
  reported on every check-in, and filled from each check-in while slots are free, with every job
  listed in the menu. Relaunching the app used to leave it reporting no encoders and zero
  concurrency — "Drained" on the Workers tab — until it was paired again, because capabilities
  were only probed at pairing; the machine is now probed on every launch.

### Fixed

- **A worker now records what its VMAF measurement actually did.** Its scratch directory is deleted
  on every exit path, so after a job ended the command, the files it compared and the score it
  produced existed nowhere. Each window is logged with its frame count, mean, harmonic mean, lowest
  frame and how many frames scored near zero, along with the timing shift applied — a window full of
  zero-scoring frames beside a respectable average is the signature of two timelines misaligned
  rather than of a bad encode, and an average alone hides it.
- **The worker's timing-shift guard tested the wrong thing.** Its check for a gap too small to
  matter multiplied the source lead by a million and compared that, rather than the difference
  between the two leads, for want of a pair of brackets. It gave the right answer for every real
  pair, which is why it went unnoticed.
- **Each job being processed gets its own card, with its own artwork.** Every running job shared
  one card carrying only the first job's backdrop, so three jobs from three different shows read as
  one thing behind the wrong picture. With remote workers this is the common case rather than a
  corner: several jobs run at once and none of them is "the" job.
- **The macOS sidecar's menu no longer changes shape or slides sideways while a job runs.** Each
  thumbnail in the film strip asked to fill the available width with no upper bound, so two dozen
  of them demanded far more than the menu's 340 points: the window grew, the content shifted left
  out of view and the panel turned square as frames accumulated. The strip is now a fixed number of
  fixed-size slots showing the tail of the run. The job number also rendered as "#5,643", because
  an integer in a label is grouped by locale.
- **A worker is no longer offered a job it has just handed back.** A released job returns to the
  queue at once, and the claim loop offers the highest-priority queued job to whoever asks next, so
  a worker that could not run a job took it again on its very next check-in and downloaded the
  whole source afresh to fail the same way. A handback now earns that worker a ten-minute pause on
  that job, which is long enough to break the loop and short enough that a Mac which was merely
  asleep is useful again quickly. The pause is per worker, so another machine can still take it. A
  job handed back three times stops being offered to workers at all and is left for the server.
- **A worker is no longer sent a job whose audio encoder it does not have.** Advanced options
  offer Opus and MP3, which the server emits as `libopus` and `libmp3lame`. The macOS sidecar's
  bundled FFmpeg links no external audio libraries and has neither, and capability matching only
  ever considered video, so such a job was handed over, failed with "Unknown encoder", and came
  straight back to be offered again. The sidecar now proves its audio encoders with a real encode
  and advertises them, and the matcher checks the job's encoder against that list. Audio that is
  copied names no encoder and needs none.
- **A worker's capabilities are refreshed on every check-in, not only at pairing.** The sidecar
  re-probes itself at each launch, but had no way to say so, so a rebuilt FFmpeg or an encoder that
  stopped opening left the server scheduling against whatever was true when the two were first
  introduced. Only pairing again corrected it. A check-in that omits capabilities, as an older
  sidecar does, leaves them untouched rather than emptying them.
- **The macOS sidecar's bundled FFmpeg runs on machines other than the one that built it.** The
  0.1.0 and 0.1.1 downloads linked Homebrew's `libxcb` and failed to start anywhere it was absent.
  The build set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, which *adds* to pkg-config's built-in search path, so configure
  still found `/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig` and linked what it discovered. It now sets
  `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`, which replaces that path, and passes `--disable-autodetect` so nothing is
  linked unless it is named. The build already checked for this and only printed the result; the
  check now fails the build, for both `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.
- **The macOS sidecar's bundled libx265 no longer crashes on its first frame.** Any libx265 encode
  segfaulted, at any resolution and with any encoder settings. FFmpeg's wrapper guards x265's
  multi-layer encoder API with `X265_BUILD >= 210` and no upper bound; x265 reverted that API at
  build 213, so a wrapper built against x265 4.2 passed an array of pointers where the library
  expected an array of pictures, and the pointer it read back was overwritten with zero. Upstream
  added the missing `X265_BUILD < 213` bound in 7.1.1, so the pinned FFmpeg moves from `n7.1` to
  `n7.1.2`. x265 stays at 4.2.
- **The macOS sidecar proves every encoder before advertising it, CPU ones included.** It used
  to trust `ffmpeg -encoders` for software encoders and only test-encode the VideoToolbox ones. The
  bundled libx265 segfaults on its first frame on Apple Silicon, and the sidecar advertised it
  anyway, so the server could have chosen an encoder that would never finish a job. Every listed
  encoder now has to complete a three-frame throwaway encode at launch, and a crash counts as a
  refusal. The ffmpeg build script also takes its tags and extra x265 cmake flags from the
  environment, so a rebuild can be tried without editing it.
- **The macOS sidecar's work-loop tests wait for a condition instead of a fixed delay.** A test
  that slept 200 ms and then asserted the job had run failed on a loaded CI runner where the first
  claim had not yet gone out, reporting a defect that did not exist. The shared `waitFor` helper
  polls with a generous timeout, so these tests stay fast locally and honest under load.
- **The queue shows the command a remote worker will actually run.** A job leased to a worker
  kept whatever ffmpeg arguments and encoder this server last used for it, so the first real remote
  job displayed a stale QSV command while the Mac was encoding with VideoToolbox. Claiming now
  records the worker's encoder and arguments on the job.
- **Why a worker's VMAF evidence was refused is now in the server log.** The worker's card keeps
  only its latest problem, and a verification verdict overwrote the refusal within minutes, leaving
  no trace of the reason. Both the refusal, with its objections, and an acceptance are logged.
- **The macOS sidecar stops asking for Keychain access over and over.** An ad-hoc signature is
  derived from the binary, so it changes on every build and the Keychain treats each rebuilt copy
  as a different application; reaching the stored pairing then raised a password prompt that kept
  coming back. `make-app.sh` now takes a `SIGNING_IDENTITY` and signs with a real certificate,
  whose identity is stable across rebuilds, applying the hardened runtime and a timestamp and
  signing the bundled ffmpeg and ffprobe first. The credential store also tries the data protection
  keychain before the legacy one, and an item it cannot read without a prompt is removed and
  reported as "not paired" rather than asked for again.
- **Sampled VMAF no longer scores a candidate against its own neighbouring frames.** Both inputs
  of a sampled window are seeked to the same whole second and then paired by timestamp, but FFmpeg
  stamps frames relative to each file's container start, which is the earliest stream. A source
  whose audio leads its video by a frame of priming and a candidate whose video starts a frame
  into its container therefore present the same picture 20 ms apart: half a frame, exactly the
  cadence filter's rounding tie, so each window was a coin toss between frame N and frame N+1.
  Held frames still scored well and moving ones scored zero, which is the "lowest frame 0, mean in
  the 80s" signature that the decoder-corruption check then read as a broken hardware decode. The
  first real remote job on 2026-09-13 was re-encoded three times on that reading and failed anyway;
  on the same file the corrected measurement scores every window in the low 90s with no frame
  under 70. The measurement now seeks to the nearest source picture instant, so retained frames sit
  on slot centres, and removes the candidate's extra lead before cadence rounding. Locally the
  server measures both leads from its probes; a remote worker measures them itself with its
  ffprobe and fills in a token the server leaves in the filter, and reports no evidence rather
  than half an answer when it cannot. Full-file measurements, which rebase both timelines, were
  never affected.
- **The Workers tab now notices a sidecar pairing without a reload.** While a pairing code was on
  screen the page only counted down; it never asked the server whether the code had been redeemed
  and never refreshed the worker list, and with no worker listed yet it never refreshed at all. A
  freshly paired Mac therefore stayed invisible, under a code that had already been used, until the
  operator reloaded. The page now polls every two seconds while a code is showing, drops the code
  the moment the server no longer has it, and keeps a slow refresh going even when the list is empty.

## 0.2.12 — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **A corrupt hardware decode is now re-encoded with software decode instead of being retried at
  a higher quality and then excluded.** On two different Intel hosts, QSV decoded certain H.264 MKV
  sources into broken frames (159 of 959 in one window, all scoring zero) while the same hevc_qsv
  encoder fed by software decode scored 96. The verification gates rejected every such output, so
  no original was ever touched, but the rejection looked like a weak encode: the job spent a second
  full encode on the higher-quality retry, failed again the same way, and the file was auto-excluded
  for good. On one install that had happened to 265 MKV files while MP4 sources never failed once.
  A hardware-decoded output that fails with decoder corruption's signature — decode errors, or any
  frame below the catastrophic VMAF floor — is now re-encoded once with software decode feeding the
  same encoder, and that second result is what the gates judge. The report's context records the
  retry and why. A weak but intact encode, whose worst frame stays above the floor, keeps the
  higher-quality retry as before. Files auto-excluded by the old behaviour are not re-queued
  automatically; un-exclude them and they will be tried again the new way.

- **The progress bar could reach 100% with minutes still to run
  ([#95](https://github.com/Jellman86/optimisarr/issues/95)).** The reporter's diagnostics showed
  the encode alive and busy the whole time: ffmpeg at 280% CPU, and the job finishing on its own.
  The bar had believed the wrong clock. Progress is read from two clocks, encoded time and encoded
  frames, and took the more advanced one; a frame count derived from a nominal rate came up short,
  so the frame clock passed 100% while the time clock, still inside its range, said 94%. A clock
  that has run past its own end has proven its expectation wrong, so it is now disbelieved in
  favour of the other; only when both have overrun does the bar stop at 99% and drop the
  seconds-left estimate rather than print "~2s" from a figure it can no longer trust. The probe
  also now reads the exact frame count mkvmerge writes into Matroska files (`NUMBER_OF_FRAMES`),
  which the rate-derived estimate was standing in for.

- **A TV library's type badge read "Tv".** The API serialises the media type as `Tv` while the
  label lookup only knew `TV`, so the raw enum name leaked into the badge (and the end-to-end mock
  sent `TV`, which hid it). The lookup now accepts both and the mock sends what the API sends.

- **A transcode could sit at "100% · ~2s left" until the container was restarted
  ([#95](https://github.com/Jellman86/optimisarr/issues/95)).** The status was still Transcoding,
  which means ffmpeg had not exited; on a healthy encode the final progress block and the exit are
  the same instant (measured 0.00 s apart with the bundled build). Two things were wrong. The bar
  was rounding a value the backend deliberately keeps below one, so it claimed a finish that had
  not happened and then computed a seconds-left figure from the sliver that remained. And nothing
  watched the process: an ffmpeg that stopped exiting, or stopped reporting, held its queue slot
  forever. The bar now floors to 99% until ffmpeg actually exits, the final block is shown as
  "Finishing…" with no estimate, and a stall monitor fails the job with a reason — two minutes
  without an exit after the final block, or thirty minutes without any progress while the queue is
  not paused — and discards the output, so the retry and exclusion policies see it like any other
  failure. A paused encode is never counted; SIGSTOP silences it on purpose.

- **A frame-rate-capped encode could fail its own quality check.** The cap thinned frames with
  FFmpeg's `fps` filter, which picks each output slot by nearest timestamp. On an exact 2:1 every
  odd source frame sits precisely on the rounding boundary, so which neighbour is kept depends on
  the stream's timebase and on whether timestamps were reset first — and the verification's
  reference preparation resets them before thinning while the encode does not. The two kept
  different frames for half the picture, and a 60 → 30 encode that scores VMAF 97 against the
  right frames scored 48 against the wrong ones and was failed. Both sides now keep frames by
  index, recovered from each frame's own time and the probed source rate, which has no boundary to
  fall on; verified at 97 on the same encode. A variable-frame-rate source is no longer capped,
  since it has no "every second frame" that means the same thing to both sides. Found on the first
  real hardware run of the cap; no released build carried it.

- **The weekly secret scan now acknowledges three reviewed historical documentation examples.**
  Exact Gitleaks fingerprints suppress only the known placeholder authorization headers; new or
  changed findings continue to fail the scan.

### Changed

- **The Libraries page is calmer, and every control lives in one place.** Each library is now a
  card that leads with the number that matters (how many files) and a plain-words status: "All
  already optimal" in muted text, or "12 ready to optimise" in cyan when something is actually
  waiting — the only time the summary lights up. The four badges that were identical on every
  library (preset, schedule, auto-replace, "access ok") are gone; preset and schedule read as a
  short icon list under the path, and access is only mentioned when it is a problem. Scan is the
  one button on the card; Enqueue, Configure and Delete sit in a keyboard-operable "more actions"
  menu, so the destructive action no longer sits at equal weight to the primary one. Cards go two
  to a row and stack on a phone. "Skipped" now explains itself on hover and points at Configure ›
  Candidates for the per-file reason.

### Added

- **Stronger adaptive quantisation now reaches SVT-AV1
  ([#95](https://github.com/Jellman86/optimisarr/issues/95)).** The toggle used to do nothing on a
  CPU AV1 encode, which is exactly where the reporter tried it. SVT-AV1 already runs delta-QP
  adaptive quantisation under CRF, so "stronger" is its variance boost, which raises quality in
  flat and dark blocks on top of that default; it is sent as
  `enable-variance-boost=1:variance-boost-strength=2` through `-svtav1-params`, the only door
  SVT-AV1 options have in FFmpeg. Needs SVT-AV1 2.1 or newer; the bundled jellyfin-ffmpeg carries
  3.1.2 and accepted it on a real host. Intel QSV and VA-API still receive nothing: FFmpeg's shared
  VAAPI encoder has no per-block quantiser control at all, and QSV's only nearby knob is documented
  for bitrate-driven modes rather than the constant-quality mode used here. The library form's
  support note now says so.

- **Groundwork for remote transcoding workers, hidden in this release.** A remote worker cannot
  yet do a job for you: the macOS sidecar has done one end-to-end encode on a developer's
  machine, and worker-side quality measurement, drain controls, credential binding, resumable
  transfers, signing, and the Windows sidecar are still to build. Everything below therefore sits
  behind `OPTIMISARR_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_WORKERS=true`: without it the **Remote workers** switch
  and the **Workers** tab do not appear, the setting cannot be turned on, and every worker route
  answers 403 `workers.unavailable`, whatever an older database may have stored. The pieces that
  landed, kept here so the record is complete:
  - **A delivered candidate larger than 30 MB was refused.** The result route inherited Kestrel's
    default request body cap, meant for form posts, so the first real delivery from a Mac sidecar
    failed with "request body too large" and the worker handed the job back. The route now lifts the
    cap; it already streams the body to disk in bounded chunks, so no memory is at stake. Found by
    the live work-loop test on real hardware.

  - **A delivered candidate was named after the source rather than its own container.** A worker
    told to produce MP4 from an MKV source had its candidate stored as `.mkv`, and the replacement
    takes the final extension from that name. The container the assignment promised is now recorded
    on the lease when it is granted (migration `AddLeaseOutputExtension`) and the candidate is named
    from it; a lease with no recorded container cannot be delivered against. The same live run also
    found that looking up the delivering worker ordered leases by a date in SQLite, which SQLite
    cannot do; the ordering now happens in memory and a test asks the real database. Both found on
    the first real delivery.

  - **The macOS sidecar now does work.** On each healthy check-in while idle it claims a job, and
    runs it end to end: the server's command is validated against an explicit contract before a byte
    is fetched (known options only, the only input and output are the two placeholder tokens, no value
    that looks like a path — anything else is refused whole and the job handed back with the token
    named); the source is fetched by lease into the app's own scratch and hashed, and a transfer that
    does not match the server's hash is never encoded; the bundled ffmpeg runs while the lease is
    renewed, and losing the lease stops the encode; the candidate is hashed and delivered with both
    hashes for the server to verify exactly as it would a local encode. The menu shows the job and
    stage, and how the last job ended. Scratch is removed on every exit path; forgetting the pairing
    cancels a running job. One job at a time. VMAF is not yet measured on the Mac; the server measures
    it itself for now.

  - **A candidate delivered by a remote worker is now verified and can earn replacement.** Before
    this, a delivered candidate was set to Verifying, where nothing picked it up, and the next
    restart's recovery sweep deleted it as an interrupted encode. Delivery now lands the job in a new
    **Delivered, awaiting verification** status. The dispatcher picks such jobs up ahead of starting
    new encodes, under the same concurrency cap and activity policy, rebuilds the encode contract for
    the worker that produced the candidate, and runs every local gate against it — decode, duration,
    tail, streams, size, resolution, frame rate, and the VMAF comparison — through exactly the path a
    local encode takes. A candidate that passes becomes ready to replace or is auto-replaced as the
    library asks; one that fails is retried at higher quality or failed, as before. Restart recovery
    now tells a delivered candidate mid-verification from an interrupted local encode and keeps it.
    The queue shows **Encoding remotely** and the new status by name, both count as active, and
    clearing or cancelling treats a delivered candidate as pending work. A result arriving for a job
    the operator has cancelled is refused rather than quietly reviving it. VMAF is re-measured here
    for now; accepting a worker's own measurement is wired in with the sidecar's work loop.

  - **A remote worker can now be handed an executable assignment.** Until now every claim returned
    nothing: the assignment named no encoder and carried no encode policy, so no sidecar could be
    offered work (the characterisation test that pinned this now asserts the opposite). A claim now
    runs the same preparation as local dispatch — fresh probes, crop detection, the picture, audio
    and track contract, verification policy — with the encoder chosen from what the worker proved,
    in the same preference order this machine uses for its own hardware, and hands over the exact
    FFmpeg argument array this machine would have run. Two tokens stand in for paths, `{{input}}`
    and `{{output}}` with the container extension attached, so no path on the server is ever sent
    and a worker substitutes only its own scratch. The assignment also states the VMAF requirement
    (whether to measure, which model, frame subsample, clip mode, thresholds) so evidence can be bound
    to the policy this machine will judge by. Not offered, each with a reason in the debug log:
    remux, audio and image jobs, and jobs from adaptive-VMAF libraries whose per-title quality has
    not yet been chosen, because that selection runs on this machine's encoder and a quality chosen
    for one encoder means nothing on another. The VideoToolbox encoder family is now understood
    end to end — selection, quality, preset, tuning and the command builder — so a Mac that proves
    `hevc_videotoolbox` receives `-q:v` on Apple's scale rather than a CRF it would reject. That
    quality line is a straight mapping and still owes calibration on real hardware; the VMAF gate,
    not the mapping, is what guarantees a result.

  - **The macOS sidecar now knows what its Mac can actually do.** It bundles its own ffmpeg, built
    from pinned source rather than downloaded — no prebuilt Apple Silicon build met the requirement,
    and a worker that cannot measure quality cannot do the job at all. It then proves its hardware
    instead of assuming it: each VideoToolbox encoder is confirmed with a real throwaway encode, and
    hardware decode by encoding a clip and decoding it back, because every Apple build lists
    VideoToolbox whether or not a given machine can open it. Capabilities are probed at pairing, so
    what the server records is what the machine could do just then. A Mac that proves nothing reports
    nothing and is never offered work. **It still transcodes nothing** — no work is requested, because
    the server cannot yet finish a job returned by a worker.

  - **Remote transcoding sidecars can now be paired with a PIN.** Settings gains a **Workers** tab.
    Press Pair a sidecar, then type the code and the server address it shows into your sidecar app.
    The code lasts five minutes, works once, and is destroyed after five wrong entries, so a code
    short enough to retype stays safe. Paired workers are listed with their platform, encoders, and
    status, and can be revoked; revoking ends a worker's access immediately and keeps the record.
    Optimisarr remains the only thing that replaces, quarantines, moves, or deletes a file — a worker
    never can. **No work reaches a sidecar yet**, so pairing has no effect on your library today; it
    is there so a connection can be set up and tested while the rest is built. The entries below
    describe the routes a worker will use once that is true — claiming, fetching a source, returning
    a candidate — none of which can currently be exercised end to end.
  - **Remote workers are off unless you turn them on.** Settings → General has a Remote workers
    switch, off by default and off on upgrade. While it is off there is no Workers tab and no sidecar
    can pair or check in, so a normal single-container install is unchanged and never has to think
    about it. Turning it back off stops check-ins immediately but keeps what is already paired, so
    nothing is lost and turning it on again restores it.
  - **A remote worker can now return the file it encoded.** The upload is checksummed on arrival and
    refused if it does not match, if it was encoded from a different source, or if the worker no
    longer holds the job. An accepted file waits for verification and cannot replace anything until
    every check Optimisarr runs on its own transcodes has passed against it too.
  - **A remote worker can now download the file it has been given.** Transfers resume where they left
    off if the connection drops, and come with a checksum so the worker can confirm it received the
    file intact. A worker can only ever fetch the exact original it was assigned, and only while it
    still holds the job.
  - **The route for a worker to claim a job now exists, but no job can be offered through it yet.**
    A paired sidecar can ask for work, and Optimisarr will only ever hand out a job where the worker
    has proved it has the encoder, VMAF support, scratch space and spare concurrency that job needs.
    A claimed job leaves the queue so this machine will not also run it, and comes straight back if
    the worker gives it up or goes silent. In practice nothing is handed out: the offer names the
    encoder recorded on the job, and that is only written when *this* machine transcodes, so a queued
    job has none and the request is correctly refused as incomplete. Remote transcoding therefore has
    no effect on your library in this release.
  - **Paired sidecars now report in, and the Workers list shows whether each one is reachable.** A
    worker checks in every 30 seconds using the credential it was given at pairing, and is shown as
    offline after two minutes of silence rather than on a single missed check-in, so a brief network
    blip does not make the status flicker. Revoking a worker stops its check-ins immediately.

- **A library can now cap frame rate on re-encode.** Advanced options gain **Cap frame rate at**,
  with 60 and 30 fps stops, beside the resolution controls; this completes the framerate ask in
  #95. It is a cap, not a target: a faster source is halved until it sits under the cap (60 → 30,
  59.94 → 29.97, 120 → 30), and only clean halvings happen, because any other ratio repeats or
  skips a frame every few and judders. A source already at or under the cap keeps its rate, and so
  does one that no halving brings cleanly under it — a 45 fps source under a 30 cap is left alone
  rather than made worse. The VMAF check decimates the original identically, so it judges the frames
  that were kept against their own source frames rather than against neighbours, and the structure
  gate holds the output to the intended rate, so an encode whose fps filter was dropped somewhere
  cannot replace the original as if it had been capped. A capped encode takes over cadence from the
  variable-frame-rate handling, forces software decoding for that job (as a downscale does), and
  scales its progress estimate to the frames that survive. Nothing is set by default.

- **A library can now remove black bars on re-encode.** A **Remove black bars** switch, off by
  default, detects letterbox and pillarbox bars and crops them away, so players show the right
  shape and nothing is spent encoding black. The quality check compares against the original
  cropped the same way, so it measures the picture that is kept — which also means it cannot catch
  a wrong crop. The safety is in how the crop is chosen: several scenes are sampled and the crop
  keeps everything any of them kept, so a dark scene cannot narrow it; bars a few pixels wide are
  ignored, and a crop that would remove most of the frame is treated as a detection failure and
  skipped. The decided crop is recorded on the job so a retry reuses it rather than detecting
  again. One limitation is stated plainly in the form: a film that switches aspect ratio partway
  through can lose picture in those scenes if no sample lands on them, and the quality check will
  not warn. Leave it off for such material.

- **A library can now downscale video on re-encode.** Advanced options gain a **Downscale to**
  choice beside **Skip files above**; the two mention a height and mean opposite things, so they sit
  together. Sources already at or below the chosen height keep their own size — this only ever
  shrinks. Under the hood the exact output size is computed once from the probed source and handed
  to both the encode filter and the verification gate, so the two cannot disagree about rounding.
  That gate previously rejected any change of resolution with a message naming a "resize policy"
  that did not exist; it now has one, and holds an output to the size the encode intended rather
  than to the source. The VMAF check still compares against the original at full size, so a heavy
  downscale can honestly fail a strict quality floor. A downscale forces software decoding for that
  job, because the scale filter cannot read frames a hardware decoder leaves on the GPU; the hardware
  encoder is unaffected. Nothing is set by default.

- **A minimum bitrate can now sit under the maximum.** The **Fine-tune the encoder** group offers a
  floor once a cap is set, completing the bitrate pair asked for in #95. It is deliberately the
  less useful half: a floor forces bits into scenes that need none, so it costs space rather than
  saving any, and exists for streaming setups that stall at very low bitrates. It is refused
  without a cap or above one, because a floor is a window constraint and an inverted or open
  window cannot be honoured. It reaches x264/x265 only — NVENC reads a cap but never a floor, and
  passing it one would look applied while doing nothing. Nothing is set by default.

- **Video re-encodes can now be fine-tuned per library.** Advanced options gain a **Fine-tune the
  encoder** group with three settings: a **content tune** for animation or film grain, a **maximum
  bitrate** ceiling on top of the quality target, and **stronger adaptive quantisation** to spend
  more bits where the eye notices. Each is stored as intent rather than as a raw FFmpeg flag, so
  the encoder actually chosen for a job receives only what it understands: content tune and
  adaptive quantisation reach the software x264/x265 encoders, NVENC honours adaptive quantisation
  but has no content tune, and the bitrate cap reaches x264/x265 and NVENC. The library form says which
  encoders honour what as soon as you set one, because in Auto mode a library cannot know in
  advance which encoder it will land on. Anything a family cannot express is dropped rather than
  approximated, and a library that sets none of these builds exactly the command it always did.

- **A library can now leave chosen source codecs alone.** Each library's Advanced options list the
  codecs its media type can actually contain; pick any and files already in them are never made
  candidates, so they are never encoded and never replaced. This is for the case where a codec
  plays fine on your devices but your hardware cannot encode it — an AV1 file under an HEVC target
  would otherwise be converted, costing hours of CPU to gain little. It is separate from the
  existing automatic skips, which leave a file alone when it is already the target codec or is
  encoded efficiently enough that shrinking it is improbable; this one records that you do not want
  the work done at all, and says so as the reason. Nothing is excluded by default.

- **A library can now skip hardlinked files.** Settings for each library gain a **Skip hardlinked
  files** switch under Advanced options. A hardlink means one file on disk is reachable by more
  than one name — usually a download client still seeding the exact file Sonarr or Radarr imported.
  Both names are the same bytes, so replacing the file changes what the other one points at and can
  break a seed. While the switch is on, any file with more than one name is left out of the
  library's candidates, and so is a file whose link count cannot be read, rather than guessing. The
  count is captured by every scan and read again immediately before any replacement, so a file
  linked after it was queued is still caught. Off by default and off on upgrade, so an existing
  installation's candidates are unchanged.

## 0.2.11 — 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **The video quality strategy now uses the full library editor width and leads with Adaptive
  per-title VMAF.** Adaptive and Fixed choices share aligned card structure at desktop widths,
  while retaining a clear stacked layout on smaller screens.
- **Frontend build dependencies no longer resolve known PostCSS and nanoid advisories.** The locked
  Vite toolchain now uses PostCSS 8.5.26 and nanoid 3.3.18; neither package is included in the final
  runtime layer, and both development and production dependency audits now report zero findings.
- **Sampled VMAF now preserves the real presentation offset produced by accurate input seeks.**
  Source and output GOPs can retain their first decoded picture at different offsets from the same
  pre-roll target; Optimisarr now keeps those offsets through cadence alignment instead of
  independently rebasing the streams and comparing unrelated frames. Full-file comparisons retain
  their container-origin normalisation. This prevents false zero-score frames and unnecessary
  quality retries while continuing to fail genuinely poor outputs closed.
- **Replacement requests are now idempotent after a concurrent caller has already completed the
  same verified job.** The API returns the existing rollback record without touching either file,
  and automatic reconciliation treats that outcome as an expected no-op instead of incorrectly
  warning that the completed job was left ready to replace.

### Changed

- **Frontend and CI dependencies now use current compatible maintenance releases.** The SignalR
  client, Playwright, Svelte tooling, Vite, Node.js types, and hardened GitHub Actions runner have
  been refreshed within their existing major versions. This requires no configuration or database
  migration.
- **New video re-encode libraries now use Adaptive per-title VMAF by default.** They start with the
  Visually lossless VMAF target, three representative scoring windows, and every-frame sampling;
  Optimisarr measures bounded scenes before the full encode and selects the smallest proved passing
  quality. Fixed library quality remains available, non-video and remux-only libraries stay on the
  fixed path, and existing persisted libraries and legacy configuration imports keep their saved
  strategy. The first-run review now reports the libraries' actual VMAF policy, and an explicitly
  applied VMAF recommendation keeps the strategy and gate in a valid matching state. The Fixed-path
  description now presents it as the direct alternative instead of contradicting the new default.

## 0.2.10 — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Personal quality checks no longer run an adaptive VMAF search inside every
  anonymous video clip.** Each preset now encodes its three planned 12-second
  scenes at the concrete quality shown after reveal, even when the library uses
  Adaptive per-title VMAF for normal jobs. The completed scenes still receive
  structural verification and measure-only VMAF evidence, preserving the blind
  comparison while avoiding up to 144 redundant 40-second encode-and-score
  passes for one check.
- **Anonymous video presets now remain genuinely distinct from the library's
  current preset.** Calibration clears every preset-owned codec, container,
  HDR, video-audio, bitrate, and downmix override before resolving each
  candidate, so Scott's AAC stereo/tone-map bundle cannot leak into AV1,
  Conservative HEVC, or Compatibility H.264. Applying a revealed result uses
  that same server-owned complete bundle, including Scott's current HDR-to-SDR
  behaviour.
- **The Personal quality player now fits narrow screens without clipping.**
  Video and image stages are sized from their available width instead of a
  minimum height that could secretly make a 16:9 player wider than its card.
  The grading-bay header now keeps its identity and fullscreen control legible
  on phones, and fullscreen styling follows the named media stage rather than
  a brittle child position.

### Changed

- **Release metadata can no longer silently drift between `main` and `dev`.**
  CI now keeps the application, generated OpenAPI contract, changelog state, and
  newest release tag aligned. The release flow explicitly synchronises released
  metadata back to `dev`, restores this `Unreleased` section, and verifies the
  rebuilt `dev` image before a release is considered complete.

## 0.2.9 — 2026-07-29

### Added

- **Pull requests and roadmap work now have an explicit delivery contract.**
  Everyday changes use short-lived branches and reviewed pull requests into
  `dev`, while release pull requests alone target `main`. The roadmap records
  prioritised outcomes and evidence gates; issues retain actionable discussion,
  and pull requests retain the verified delivery slice.
- **CI now scans the repository's full history for committed secrets.** Gitleaks
  runs on pull requests, pushes to `dev` and `main`, a weekly schedule, and
  manual dispatch with read-only repository permissions.
- **Verification policy now belongs to each library.** Duration, stream-retention, size, audio
  fidelity, image-quality, metadata, and existing VMAF gates are grouped in the library editor and
  shown only when they apply to that media type. General Settings is reduced to queue/hardware and
  replacement/cleanup policy, dependent thresholds stay hidden until enabled, and narrow layouts no
  longer gain horizontal overflow from help text. A backwards-safe migration copies every former
  global value to every existing library, configuration backup/import preserves those values, and
  dispatch resolves one immutable library policy for preparation and final verification.
- **Video libraries can opt into adaptive per-title VMAF quality selection.** A clear pair of
  library-level radio paths keeps the existing fixed quality as the default or runs an experimental,
  bounded preparation search across deterministic early/middle/late scenes. Adaptive mode tests at
  most four encoder-specific values, compares the real encoded video bytes of every passing
  candidate rather than assuming a quality number is smaller, rejects non-monotonic VMAF evidence,
  and falls back to the library value when sampling is unavailable or ambiguous. It then performs
  the normal full encode and every existing verification gate. Its selected value survives
  automatic and operator retries so the one higher-quality recovery step cannot accidentally
  discard or lower the proved choice.
- **HDR-to-SDR jobs can now opt into Intel hardware tone mapping.** The existing per-library HDR
  drop-down still decides whether media is tone-mapped; a separate Settings → General → Queue
  control chooses the compatible software engine or supported QSV/VA-API VPP. Hardware mode first
  freshly confirms a non-Dolby-Vision HDR10/PQ source, then keeps decode, colour conversion, and
  encode on GPU surfaces. HLG, Dolby Vision, unknown colour metadata, preview/personal-quality
  clips, and VMAF-gated work retain their compatible frame- and colour-matched software paths.
  A recognised filter or driver failure deletes partial output and retries once through software.
  Software remains the default, NVIDIA retains software tone mapping, and every normal verification
  gate remains unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Information tooltips now stay translated and readable.** Switch help buttons
  no longer announce a hard-coded English “About” label in other languages, and
  every tooltip is programmatically associated with its button. Long translated
  help remains inside short phone and landscape viewports with a scrollable
  reading area, while the locale audit now rejects blank source or translated
  strings. Reviewed help text also distinguishes full-file VMAF cost from its
  cheaper sampling options and reflects the selectable software or supported
  hardware HDR tone-map engine.
- **VMAF now compares the same decoded picture across container timestamp origins.** Before
  cadence normalisation, each decoded input is rebased to zero; FFmpeg's `fps(start_time=0)` can no
  longer pad an MP4 candidate while leaving its Matroska reference untouched and accidentally score
  adjacent frames. This corrects false low VMAF results seen with otherwise frame-aligned QSV
  H.264/HEVC Personal quality samples and applies to Preview, adaptive sampling, and normal VMAF
  verification through their shared scorer.
- **Preview and Personal quality video clips now keep copied audio on the exact picture timeline.**
  A bounded coarse seek still avoids decoding from the beginning of a long source, followed by an
  exact output seek that trims re-encoded video and copied audio/subtitles to the same requested
  instant. Long-GOP sources therefore no longer produce multi-second A/V offsets or inflated sample
  durations. Preview and Personal quality sample placement now freshly prefers the primary video
  duration, and newly probed inventory records use that same playable timeline, so subtitles or
  ancillary streams cannot move a middle or late sample beyond picture EOF.
- **Translated setup now stays accessible inside the complete library editor.** The active locale
  updates the document language for assistive technology, media-type names are translated without
  changing the stable API values saved for each library, and compact Browse, Save, Cancel, and
  information controls expose 44 px touch targets. Browser coverage now opens the real embedded
  editor from first-run setup and verifies its localisation, mobile reflow, and control geometry.
- **Video previews now stay on the same source frame and report honest progress.** The preview API
  exposes the exact middle-sample start and duration, and the two native browser players share one
  source-relative clock for their initial position, play, pause, seek, playback rate, and drift
  correction. The players still stream the two real files independently, so native controls,
  fullscreen, and downloads remain available. FFmpeg frame counts now provide a progress fallback
  when copied-stream timestamps remain at zero, while adaptive VMAF preparation reports its bounded
  candidate, window, and measurement work instead of appearing stuck during a real encode or score.
- **Subtitles and ancillary tracks no longer create false Duration or source-corruption failures.**
  Normal, preview, and personal-quality video verification compare the measured primary-picture span
  with the corresponding source window instead of a container duration that subtitles, chapters, or
  attachments may extend. The separate source-timeline safety gate remains strict, but now requires
  primary audio to materially outlast the picture before reporting an incomplete source video.
- **Adaptive per-title quality now measures every planned VMAF window.** Removing one completed
  sample no longer prunes the shared scratch directory needed by the next early, middle, or late
  sample. Sample positions also follow the primary picture duration rather than a container timeline
  that subtitles or ancillary tracks may extend, so a middle or late seek cannot land beyond video
  EOF. Matroska's nanosecond-precision stream duration tags are parsed across multi-minute and
  multi-hour values instead of intermittently falling back to format duration. Adaptive mode now
  selects a proved per-title encoder value instead of silently falling back to the library value
  after its first measurement.
- **Intel QSV previews now compare the same source frames.** Short disposable video previews and
  personal-quality clips keep hardware encoding but use software source decoding, avoiding the
  reordered frames QSV can expose before a long-GOP input seek. The main encode pipeline retains
  hardware decoding. Preview reference pre-roll is also excluded from duration and tail decisions,
  so a copied preceding keyframe cannot make an exact 60-second candidate look truncated.
- **An explicitly requested Preview no longer waits for the library's overnight optimise window.**
  It still respects queue concurrency, free-space protection, manual pause, and active-media
  blocking; only the background-work schedule is bypassed.

### Changed

- **Global Settings now follows the same guided structure as each library.**
  Numbered, task-oriented sections give General, Connections, Notifications,
  Tools, and Backup a consistent reading order, while the first-run setup
  action now lives with backup and restore controls. Settings tabs expose
  standard keyboard navigation, mobile actions meet touch-target guidance, and
  long tool paths, statuses, and encoder names wrap inside the viewport instead
  of overflowing narrow or landscape layouts.
- **Scott's Settings now matches the current reference encoding bundle.** The preset still targets
  HEVC/MP4 at CRF 24 with AAC 96 kbps stereo, but now tone-maps HDR to SDR instead of preserving it.
  The global tone-map setting continues to choose compatible software or supported hardware.
  Verification gates, automation, and per-library same-codec size thresholds remain independent
  library policy and are not silently changed when the encoding preset is selected.
- **Library configuration now follows one consistent four-stage flow.** Film/TV, Music, Photo, and
  mixed libraries use the same numbered **Library → Optimisation → Verification gates → Automation
  & completion** sections instead of one long card with unrelated dividers. Music exposes its
  primary codec and bitrate without requiring Advanced options, completed-output routing now sits
  beside the automation choices it affects, and Advanced is limited to technical encoding and
  eligibility overrides. Save/Cancel pins only after a change and remains in the document flow on
  short landscape screens, so it no longer obscures most of the editor.
- **The roadmap now defines optional Windows and macOS compute sidecars.** The planned
  distributed-transcoding design keeps the main container in control of scheduling and all
  replacement actions, while registered workers may receive read-only media, encode and VMAF-score
  candidates, and return hash-bound results. It also records secure pairing, resumable or
  shared-storage delivery, capability-aware leases, fail-closed verification, native packaging,
  and cross-platform acceptance requirements.
- **Per-title VMAF-guided quality targeting remains an experimental validation item.** The initial
  bounded implementation is available for opt-in testing; release support still requires evidence
  across CPU, QSV, NVENC, and VA-API that its extra work produces stable, worthwhile choices.

## 0.2.8 — 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Every saved notification target now has a Test action.** Settings → Notifications can send a
  clearly labelled test through Webhook, Discord, Telegram, ntfy, or Apprise without waiting for a
  media event. Success and provider rejection are shown inline, and invalid target settings now show
  the API's specific reason instead of a generic validation message.
- **Telegram is now a first-class notification target.** Settings → Notifications accepts a bot
  token plus a numeric chat ID or public `@channelusername`, then sends replacement and failure
  alerts directly through Telegram's official Bot API. When existing artwork is available,
  Optimisarr uploads the title poster, audio cover, or image thumbnail with the caption; a missing,
  slow or oversized image falls back before upload, and an image Telegram explicitly identifies as
  invalid or unsupported falls back after rejection. Ambiguous timeouts, rate limits, and server
  errors are not retried to avoid duplicate notifications. The token stays write-only,
  targets are validated before saving, message limits are enforced, and the
  existing best-effort delivery policy keeps notification failures out of the media workflow.
- **NVIDIA contributors can now run one guided quality comparison from the `dev` container.** The
  packaged helper creates `/data/Optimisarr-NVENC-Test`, asks for exactly three short 8-bit SDR clips,
  and compares the current Efficient baseline with multipass, lookahead, spatial-AQ, and temporal-AQ
  variants for H.264 and HEVC NVENC. It leaves every source unchanged, validates and VMAF-scores each
  output, records size and sub-second speed measurements, samples both NVENC and overall GPU use,
  treats hardware-rejected optional variants as capability skips with privacy-safe diagnostics,
  removes temporary encodes by default, and writes one timestamped text report with source names and
  paths omitted. Initial GTX 1080 results found no advanced combination that consistently improved
  both quality and size, so production encoding remains unchanged and the helper is retained for
  evidence from future hardware generations.
- **NVIDIA transcodes can now decode on the GPU as well as encode there.** When Hardware decoding
  is enabled, an NVENC job uses NVDEC through FFmpeg's CUDA hardware-acceleration path and keeps
  decoded frames in GPU memory through the encode. Unsupported source codecs, profiles, or GPU
  setups automatically retry once with software decoding, and HDR-to-SDR jobs retain their existing
  software tone-map path.
- **Verified queue outputs can now be replaced as one reviewed batch.** Queue shows **Replace all**
  when one or more normal jobs are verified and ready. One confirmation snapshots the eligible jobs,
  moves every original to quarantine through the existing rollback-safe replacement path, and opens
  Quarantine once after the batch succeeds. A failed item does not stop later safe replacements; the
  Queue stays open and reports the remaining failures for review. The same operation is available as
  `POST /api/jobs/replace-ready` and skips unverified or no-longer-ready jobs.

### Fixed

- **Compatibility H.264 no longer creates poorly supported High 10 output.** Normal and preview
  eligibility now leaves video above 8-bit untouched and recommends Balanced HEVC or Efficiency AV1
  instead of preserving it as H.264 High 10 or silently reducing its bit depth. Unknown bit depth
  fails closed until the source is re-probed, effective custom H.264 targets cannot bypass the guard,
  and personal quality checks omit the incompatible H.264 candidate while keeping their remaining
  depth-preserving comparisons. The preset description and operator documentation now state the
  8-bit boundary explicitly; existing encoder and replacement-verification gates remain as defensive
  backstops.
- **Encoder effort can no longer send an incompatible preset to FFmpeg.** The per-library control
  now stores the portable choices **Fast**, **Balanced**, and **Efficient**, then resolves them only
  after Auto or an explicit mode has selected the exact encoder. x264/x265, SVT-AV1, NVIDIA NVENC,
  and Intel QSV each receive their own valid preset vocabulary; VAAPI keeps its driver default.
  Existing CPU names, NVENC `p1`–`p7`, and SVT-AV1 `0`–`13` values remain visible and retain their
  exact native behaviour until deliberately replaced; when another encoder family is selected they
  resolve to its closest safe effort. Unknown values fail before FFmpeg starts with an actionable
  **Invalid configuration** reason. Config backups, the API, all translated library controls, and
  defensive FFmpeg error interpretation use the same policy.

## 0.2.7 — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Active encodes now report progress from FFmpeg's machine-readable protocol.** Video, audio,
  and image jobs no longer depend on terminal-style stderr updates that can remain buffered in a
  container and leave the progress bar at zero. The first measurable movement is persisted even
  when it is below one percent, live speed/FPS/ETA continues at FFmpeg's update cadence, timestamp
  discontinuities cannot move the bar backwards, and progress delivery failures no longer stop the
  process pipes from being consumed. Stderr is kept separately as bounded diagnostic evidence, so
  switching progress transports does not hide encode warnings or failure details.

### Changed

- **Runtime and build dependencies are current for this release.** The aligned ASP.NET Core and
  Entity Framework Core packages move from 10.0.9 to 10.0.10, while the OpenAPI and test tooling,
  Svelte, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and frontend validation packages receive their compatible minor or
  patch updates. GitHub Actions now uses the current setup actions for .NET and Node.js. These
  maintenance updates do not change Optimisarr's configuration, database schema, or safety model.

## 0.2.6 — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **The queue can now be paused manually.** The **Pause queue** control at the top right of Queue
  blocks new jobs and automatic replacements, then suspends running transcodes where the platform
  supports POSIX process signals without losing progress. Verification already underway finishes;
  unsupported or partial suspension is reported explicitly. **Resume queue** must successfully
  continue every still-running suspended process before dispatch reopens. The state persists across
  restarts without holding container shutdown on a stopped child, concurrent transitions and
  automatic replacement are serialized, and the API exposes the exact mode and process counts.
  (`POST /api/queue/pause`, `POST /api/queue/resume`.) Contributed by Scott Brant.

### Changed

- **Timed cleanup now prevents failed outputs from filling `/work`.** The existing retention
  sweep and setting now cover both quarantined originals and failed normal-job outputs. Expired
  scratch files are removed at startup or on the six-hour sweep, while the failed job, output-size
  evidence, verification report, classification, FFmpeg arguments, and process log remain available
  for diagnosis. Active, queued, verifying, ready-to-replace, completed, calibration, outside-root,
  and shared work paths are protected. Dry-run continues to protect every original but does not
  retain reproducible failed scratch indefinitely. The setting is now presented as **Cleanup
  retention**; its persisted and API names remain compatible with existing installs and backups.
  Settings now previews the exact eligible disk usage with separate failed-work and quarantine
  totals, and **Clean up now** applies the same saved policy after a permanent-deletion warning.
  A changed preview is rejected without deleting anything, so every run matches the files and
  space the operator actually confirmed.

## 0.2.5 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Ten-bit H.264 sources no longer reach an incompatible hardware encoder.** In **Auto** mode,
  an H.264 target now selects the bundled 10-bit-capable `libx264` encoder when preserving the
  source depth rules out NVENC, Intel QSV, and VA-API. A forced hardware mode fails before FFmpeg
  starts with an actionable explanation instead of reaching frame zero and reporting `Function not
  implemented`; sources above 10-bit fail closed because no supported H.264 path can preserve them.
- **Video verification now compares the same frames and identifies damaged sources honestly.**
  Sampled VMAF places the source and output on the source's measured frame cadence before trimming,
  preventing millisecond-versus-codec timebases from pairing adjacent pictures and producing false
  zero scores at movement or cuts. Tail verification now compares the output with the source video's
  actual packet endpoint and reports a source picture stream that ends early as **Source video
  timeline**, rather than blaming the encode for the container's audio-only remainder. Unmeasured
  VMAF evidence still fails closed, but no longer triggers a pointless higher-quality retry or an
  immediate automatic exclusion.
- **Personal quality-check clips with a non-zero media epoch no longer fail Duration.** The
  verifier now compares the measured picture span with the exact calibration window instead of
  mistaking an absolute end timestamp—or copied subtitle/attachment padding—for clip runtime.
  Full-file jobs retain their existing container-duration check.
- **The personal quality check is no longer part-English for translated installs.** Eleven strings
  on that screen were hardcoded in the component instead of going through the locale files,
  including the **Temporary stream verification** and **Ignore active media streams for this check**
  options and the sample-deck instruction — so every non-English user saw them in English next to
  correctly translated text. They now resolve through `i18n` and ship in all ten languages. The
  locale audit only validates the locale files, so it could not catch strings that never reached
  them.
- **The personal quality check now has one name.** The page introduced itself as "Quality lab"
  under an eyebrow reading "Personal quality check", while the control that opens it said a third
  thing. The heading, the browser tab, the library card, and its button now all say **Personal
  quality check**.
- **Track cleanup no longer points at controls it hides.** Selecting "Only remove unwanted
  audio/subtitle languages" warns that the preset does nothing until a keep-language rule is set —
  but **Keep audio languages** and **Keep subtitle languages** lived inside the collapsed Advanced
  drawer, so the warning referred to fields that were not on the page. They are now rendered
  directly beneath that warning whenever track cleanup is selected, and stay in Advanced > Video for
  the encode and remux modes that treat them as a refinement.

### Changed

- **The library configuration form is easier to scan.** Every top-level group is now named the way
  the Advanced sections already were — **Library** for the name, path, and media type, and
  **Automation** for the enabled/auto-optimise/auto-replace switches, which previously floated
  between the quality policy and Advanced with no heading of their own. Save and Cancel appeared
  twice on the same screen, in the header and again at the foot of the form; there is now one pair,
  in an action bar that stays pinned to the bottom of the viewport so Save remains reachable when
  Advanced options make the form several screens tall. The perceptual-quality control no longer
  repeats itself in a paragraph above and below the picker, the "Custom" stop on the quality slider
  no longer renders a dash where a codec would go, and the calibration card, its button, and its
  tooltip all now call the feature **Personal quality check** instead of alternating with "Blind
  quality calibration". The gap between top-level groups was three different values (16/20/24px)
  with dividers on some boundaries and not others; it is now one rhythm, matching the uniform
  spacing the Advanced sections already used. The three processing-mode cards no longer stretch to
  the height of the longest one, which had left the two shorter cards with a block of dead space.
  No rule, default, or safety gate changed.

### Fixed

- **Unrecoverable quality and size failures no longer burn repeated full encodes.** A VMAF-only
  rejection still receives one encoder-aware higher-quality retry, but a second VMAF rejection now
  auto-excludes the file. Size-saving failures—including combined size and VMAF failures—exclude
  immediately because raising quality worsens size and silently lowering the configured quality would
  violate the selected output. Other failures keep the conservative three-attempt threshold;
  cancellations and worker-restart interruptions never count. Every exclusion is reasoned, reversible,
  and leaves the original untouched.
- **Short video quality samples no longer fail duration verification because of harmless audio
  padding.** Video calibration now compares the candidate picture stream's duration with the exact
  12-second reference window instead of using a container duration extended by AAC frames or codec
  delay. Decode, timestamp, tail-integrity, audio-retention, and container checks still run against
  the complete preset output.
- **Personal quality-check preparation now shows live CPU and GPU usage.** The preparation window
  reuses the same rolling system-usage graphs as active work in the Queue hero, including the
  detected GPU engine and the honest unavailable state when the host cannot expose GPU telemetry.
- **Video quality checks no longer mistake complete preset samples for truncated output, and their
  failures remain diagnosable.** Candidate files still encode each preset's complete video,
  container, and audio contract, while the unchanged original reference again uses the exact
  video-only picture window required for duration, tail, and frame-alignment verification. Failed
  preview and personal-quality jobs retain only their small database diagnostics after scratch
  media is removed. The failure API and Queue failure view now identify comparison jobs and expose
  every failed verification gate with its measured detail; the same detail is written to container
  logs. **Clear errored** removes these retained diagnostic rows.
- **Personal quality-check preparation now moves forward steadily and can explicitly bypass active
  playback.** The displayed preparation percentage keeps the highest measured session progress, so
  FFmpeg stage changes cannot make it jump backwards. A per-check, default-off option allows only
  that disposable calibration session to start while Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby reports active
  playback; normal optimisation jobs remain paused behind the media-activity safety gate.
- **Video quality checks now test the real preset outputs and sample selection responds on the
  first click.** The video lineup is the library slider's four complete presets—Compatibility
  H.264/MP4, Balanced HEVC/MP4, Efficiency AV1/MKV, and Scott's bundle—instead of five CRF values
  encoded through one codec/container. Applying a result selects that preset and clears stale
  codec/container overrides without queueing normal work. Candidate cards no longer combine drag
  and click gestures or discard a click while another stream is seeking; the latest selection wins
  while frame alignment remains fail-closed. A temporary, opt-in-at-the-API diagnostic mode is on
  by default in the lab. Verification mode now uses one native browser video player and replaces
  that element's media resource on every selection instead of keeping several hidden players. It
  exposes the element's real `currentSrc`, native controls, and a direct link that opens that exact
  resource in a browser tab, while retaining the aligned seek before the replacement frame appears.
- **Personal quality checks are now finite, reference-led, frame-aligned, and usable for a complete
  session.** The former repeated A/B/X trial loop is replaced by one marked original reference and
  shuffled anonymous candidates. Only the candidates require classification, so each rating
  has a stable quality baseline without forcing a worst-to-best ranking. Video switching waits for
  the destination stream to seek to the same source frame before
  it becomes visible or resumes, removing the timing jump that could reveal a version, and playback
  continues across all scenes instead of stopping after the first comparison.
- **Personal quality checks now explain queue waits instead of appearing frozen at 0%.** If all
  processing slots are occupied, calibration preparation shows an indeterminate waiting state and
  says it will start automatically. Once a worker is available, the panel returns to real sample
  preparation progress; no running encode is interrupted or reordered unsafely.
- **Personal quality checks are now reachable from Music and Photo libraries.** The audio and still-image
  comparison pipelines were available, but their per-library entry point was incorrectly nested
  inside the video preset controls. Saved Music and Photo libraries now show the same **Personal
  quality check** action as Film, TV, and mixed libraries.
- **Blind video checks no longer reject healthy samples as too short.** Some long-GOP TV and film
  sources can only be stream-copied from the keyframe immediately before the requested scene. That
  harmless decode pre-roll made a 12-second original-side clip appear longer than its encoded match,
  so every quality level failed the Duration and Tail integrity gates. Optimisarr now verifies the
  requested 12-second picture window, records the hidden pre-roll, and starts original playback at
  the matching frame. Original references
  remain available until the disposable session is closed or expires instead of being removed as
  soon as verification finishes. One accessible shared timeline now controls every blind stream,
  so native container duration cannot reveal which slot carries hidden decode pre-roll. No source
  file is changed.

### Added

- **Temporary stream verification is now opt-in.** Personal video quality checks start blind by
  default; native player controls and exact-resource diagnostics appear only when explicitly enabled.
- **Revealed video quality checks now include VMAF evidence in both the lab and API.** Every preset
  is measured across all three scenes without turning VMAF into a hidden pass/fail gate or allowing
  it to override the user's blind ratings. The result shows harmonic mean, worst-scene fifth
  percentile, and lowest frame; the session API also returns the complete per-scene measurements,
  model, preprocessing, frame counts, and explicit measurement errors. A new authenticated active-
  session endpoint makes current results discoverable without knowing their session IDs.
- **Track cleanup profile.** A new rule profile that only removes audio/subtitle tracks outside
  the library's kept languages — no re-encode, no container change (an `.mkv` stays `.mkv`).
  Every kept stream is copied bit-identically; a file with nothing to remove is skipped with a
  clear reason, and the library form presents encode, remux, and track cleanup as three exclusive
  processing modes. Irrelevant encode, VMAF, audio-only, image, and eligibility controls are hidden
  in cleanup mode. Verification additionally confirms the output container and retained audio
  codecs match the source.
  Migration `AddTrackCleanupSupport`.
- **Per-library "Keep subtitle languages" removes unwanted subtitle tracks.** Mirrors the audio
  rule on every profile: comma-separated ISO 639 codes, `-map -0:s:N` exclusions, unknown-language
  tracks never removed, common spellings of the same language match each other. Only positively
  registered individual ISO 639 languages may authorise removal; malformed, unregistered,
  collective, special-purpose, and private-use identifiers fail closed and keep the track. A
  partly invalid stored rule disables the whole rule rather than silently broadening deletion.
  One deliberate
  difference from audio: subtitles are optional streams, so there is no keep-at-least-one guard —
  an all-foreign subtitle set is removed entirely. The probe now records each subtitle track's
  language (rows probed before the upgrade are queued for background re-probing), and every
  destructive dispatch requires a fresh successful source probe. The subtitle-retention gate
  expects exactly the planned removal and verifies the identities of retained known-language
  tracks, so an encode that drops or swaps the wrong stream still fails.
- **The queue shows why each job is queued.** Every job records its eligibility reason at enqueue
  time (e.g. `h264 → hevc`, `Remove 2 audio track(s) (fra, deu) not in the kept languages`) and
  the Queue page shows it on the active-job card and each row. Track-removal reasons name the
  languages being removed, not just counts.

  The Track Cleanup, subtitle-language, and queue-reason features above were contributed by
  [@smidley](https://github.com/smidley) in [PR #29](https://github.com/Jellman86/optimisarr/pull/29),
  building on their original audio-language contribution.

- **A full-page personal quality lab for video.** A saved video library can prepare short,
  disposable samples from the beginning, middle, and end of a representative file, then compare a
  marked original reference and four shuffled anonymous candidates covering the library's real
  preset slider. Candidate settings and estimated sizes remain hidden until all four are
  classified as Indistinguishable, Acceptable, or Visibly worse. One large synchronized viewer,
  scene controls, and real browser fullscreen support close inspection without a 25-trial loop. The
  result recommends the most compressed acceptable setting but never claims encodes are equivalent.
  The original is read-only, scratch clips
  are removed when the panel closes, after being abandoned for two hours, or when the app restarts;
  nothing enters the normal queue or replacement path, and the suggested preset changes the
  library only after an explicit Apply.
  Native playback fails closed when the browser cannot decode a candidate. HDR is available only
  when the library preserves HDR and the browser reports an HDR-capable display path; the user must
  also confirm that the normal viewing display is actually presenting HDR. Dolby Vision remains
  unavailable because a re-encode cannot safely retain its dynamic metadata. Content-complexity
  source guidance and metric correlation remain on the roadmap.
- **A level-matched blind audio check.** Music and mixed libraries can now calibrate their saved
  Opus, AAC, or MP3 bitrate using three repeatable 15-second excerpts and the same marked-reference,
  anonymous-candidate classification model. Optimisarr creates a lossless FLAC reference for browser
  playback, measures the full lineup with EBU R128 integrated loudness, and attenuates every version
  to the quietest measured level so volume cannot reveal the answer or introduce clipping. The result applies
  only the library's audio bitrate after an explicit confirmation; every candidate remains
  disposable and outside replacement, history, notifications, and the normal queue.
- **A zoom-synchronised blind image check.** Photo and mixed libraries can now compare a lossless
  PNG view of one still image against five hidden output-quality levels. The reference and A–E share exactly one
  viewport, so zoom and pan stay fixed when switching and spatial position cannot give the answer
  away. The PNG reference carries the source colour metadata when the configured metadata tool can
  copy it, animated images are excluded, browser loading fails closed, and Apply changes only the
  library's saved image quality without queueing work.
- **Gold-standard first-run recommendations and final review.** Setup now turns proved encoder and
  VMAF capabilities into visible, reversible encoder, hardware-decode, VMAF, and overnight-window
  recommendations instead of silently choosing for the operator. When a probed candidate exists,
  the wizard can run the established disposable original-versus-output preview without touching the
  source. The final check-answers page now covers network security, storage, libraries, encoder,
  quality, scheduling, optional connections, and replacement, with accessible Change actions that
  preserve the draft. One validated database transaction applies the reviewed settings and opted-in
  per-library recommendations, records completion, and returns a no-work-started receipt linking to
  candidate review or the dashboard; duplicate submissions return that completed state without
  changing the applied plan. Draft safety choices survive refresh in local browser storage, inline
  validation is tied to its field and focused error summary, and the new browser acceptance suite
  exercises keyboard flows, re-test announcements, final apply, dark/reduced-motion presentation,
  320px reflow, landscape, 390px mobile, and all nine locales in CI.

## 0.2.4 — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **A maintained hardware validation matrix.** CPU, NVIDIA NVENC, Intel QSV, Intel/AMD VA-API,
  hardware decode, VMAF acceleration, and live metrics now have one public evidence table that
  distinguishes implemented/unit-tested paths from real-host validation. It records known gaps and
  an exact, non-secret evidence checklist; AMD VA-API and current CUDA VMAF remain honestly pending
  instead of being implied by device detection or command coverage.
- **Resumable, safety-first first-run setup.** A genuinely new database now opens a five-step
  setup workspace for deployment/tool checks, creation and full configuration of any number of
  conservatively configured libraries,
  dry-run/concurrency choices, and a final no-work-started review. Progress is versioned and
  persisted after each completed step, duplicate submissions are idempotent, Back retains applied
  choices, and completion is possible only from the review step. Upgraded installations are marked
  complete and never forced through onboarding; the Settings header offers an explicit **Run setup
  again** action that keeps every existing library and setting. The library step reuses the complete
  per-library rules editor, rechecks every configured path before Continue, and keeps Add/Configure
  actions available until the operator is ready. Fresh installs start in dry-run,
  automatic enqueue/replacement and VMAF remain off, and the readiness ledger reports database,
  config/work/quarantine/library path access, filesystem and container-mount identities, free and
  total capacity, the configured work-space reserve, required tools, and detected hardware encoders.
  It identifies whether each library can use atomic moves to work and quarantine, states when the
  verified cross-filesystem fallback is disabled, and gives selectable, exact recovery steps for
  local, Docker Compose, Unraid, and TrueNAS deployments. **Re-test system** reruns the real probes,
  announces completion, and removes resolved guidance without pretending a container can repair its
  own host mounts or permissions. The focused
  responsive layout ships in all nine locales with text status alongside colour and keyboard focus
  moved to actionable errors. Shared form sizing and unit-bearing fields now remain inside General
  Settings cards at phone widths, with long toggle labels wrapping instead of being truncated.
- **Dedicated library configuration pages and library-owned VMAF policies.** Configure now
  opens a full-page Rules workspace instead of expanding an increasingly dense library card, while
  Candidates and Excluded remain adjacent tabs on the same canonical library URL. Each video
  library can disable its VMAF gate, select a Space-saver through Archival quality tier, or enter
  custom harmonic-mean, fifth-percentile, and catastrophic-frame floors. Clip/full-file scoring and
  the 1st–10th-frame sampling interval are also library-owned. The upgrade migration materialises
  the former global policy onto existing libraries and removes its obsolete settings; older config
  backups receive the same conversion during import. API/import validation enforces safe ranges and
  ordered floors. The responsive editor keeps primary choices visible, uses a compact borderless
  summary for effective floors, progressively discloses advanced encoding controls, warns before
  discarding changes, and exposes non-overlapping Save/Cancel actions on desktop and mobile.
- **Encoder-aware VMAF recovery and safer temporal pooling.** Hardware quality controls now receive
  conservative encoder-family calibration (QSV ICQ, NVENC CQ, VA-API QP) instead of treating their
  numeric values as interchangeable with software CRF. Verification pools harmonic mean, fifth
  percentile, and a catastrophic single-frame floor; optional fast scoring uses deterministic
  early/middle/late windows. If VMAF is the only failed gate, Optimisarr automatically retries once
  at a higher encoder-specific quality. The Queue persists and displays the requested/effective
  quality and sampling context, offers explicit same-settings and higher-quality recovery actions,
  and container shutdown now drains active jobs for up to two hours before safe cancellation.
- **Hardware-assisted and subsampled VMAF with automatic software fallback.** SDR verification now
  follows the job's selected NVIDIA/QSV/VA-API hardware path when Hardware decoding is enabled:
  NVIDIA can keep both inputs on the GPU through NVDEC, bicubic `scale_cuda`, and `libvmaf_cuda`,
  while QSV/VA-API can offload both decodes before downloading frames for CPU VMAF. CUDA is enabled
  only when the configured binary exposes the exact filter (`OPTIMISARR_FFMPEG_VMAF_CUDA` can point
  at a purpose-built binary), and every accelerated runtime failure is discarded and retried through
  the established software graph. HDR deliberately stays on the colour-accurate software path. A new
  Frame sampling control scores every 1st–10th frame (default 1/every frame) with a warning that
  skipped frames weaken the worst-frame floor. Incidental PSNR/SSIM features are no longer computed
  during the VMAF gate, avoiding work that does not affect replacement safety.
- **Optional sampled VMAF (faster quality gate on modest hardware).** A per-library control under
  the quality policy measures VMAF across three 40-second windows near the beginning, middle and end
  instead of the whole runtime, which cuts VMAF time dramatically on low-power hosts (e.g. an Intel
  N100) where full-file scoring is impractical. Both the output and original are sought to each
  matching window, and progress is reported across all three samples. The other
  gates (decode health, duration, structure, size) still check the whole output. Off by default, and
  skipped for short files where full scoring is comparable. VMAF's scoring acceleration remains NVIDIA-only;
  Intel/AMD hardware can offload decode but not the metric itself.
- **Per-library "Keep audio languages" removes unwanted audio tracks.** A library can list the
  ISO 639 codes to keep (e.g. `eng, jpn`); when a video is optimised or remuxed, audio tracks in
  any other language are dropped from the output via explicit `-map -0:a:N` exclusions. The
  behaviour is conservative by design: unknown, malformed, uncoded, and private-use language tags
  are never removed, and when no track matches a kept language nothing is removed. The complete
  ISO 639-1/-2 aliases match each other (`de`/`deu`/`ger`). Verification requires exactly the
  planned nonzero retention and judges channel/sample-rate fidelity against the kept tracks. The
  upgrade queues existing videos with audio for background re-probing, and every destructive job
  obtains a fresh successful source probe before FFmpeg,
  so already-clean remuxes become eligible for fast stream-copy cleanup. The accessible library
  control validates and normalises input before save in every locale, and config backup/restore
  uses the same validator. Migration `AddKeepAudioLanguages`. Contributed by
  [@smidley](https://github.com/smidley) in [PR #28](https://github.com/Jellman86/optimisarr/pull/28).

### Fixed

- **Queue capacity now follows the real work filesystem.** Free-space checks select the deepest
  mounted filesystem containing the configured work path, so a bind-mounted `/work` no longer
  reports the container overlay's much smaller capacity or pauses a healthy queue prematurely.
- **Abandoned work output is reclaimed safely.** Clearing, deleting, or retrying a failed job now
  removes its owned scratch output before dropping the database reference and retains the job if
  cleanup cannot be completed. Startup also removes output left by cancelled jobs and numeric,
  unreferenced work directories older than seven days, while retaining recent or referenced data.
- **Credential-bearing integration URLs are excluded from normal logs.** Default logging now keeps
  `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` request messages at Warning or above, preventing Discord webhook URLs
  and similar outbound credentials from appearing in ordinary Information-level container logs.
- **First-run review copy uses locale-aware singular and plural forms.** The setup summary now reads
  naturally for one or many concurrent jobs in every supported language.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Live verification progress in the queue.** The perceptual-quality (VMAF) pass is the long part
  of verification, so it now reports real 0–100% progress on the same job-progress and live-update
  channel the transcode uses (ffmpeg `-stats` parsed against the source runtime). The Queue hero and
  job rows show a determinate bar and percentage during verification and name the stage explicitly
  ("Scoring perceptual quality (VMAF)…"), so a job scoring for several minutes reads as active work
  rather than a stall. The hero also shows a live CPU-usage graph during verification — VMAF is
  CPU-only, so it surfaces just the CPU load (no GPU), making the heavy load visible at a glance.
- **Internationalisation (i18n) foundation.** The web UI now resolves user-facing text through a
  typed locale system (`web/src/lib/i18n/`): English is the source of truth, and every other locale
  is typed against it, so a missing or misspelled key fails `npm run check` — making translation
  completeness a compile-time CI gate rather than something that can silently rot. A lightweight
  runes store exposes the active locale's messages and a `t()` interpolation helper, the choice is
  persisted (and falls back to the browser language, then English), and a language selector lives in
  the sidebar. German ships as the first translated locale. **Every page is migrated** — the app
  shell and navigation, plus Dashboard, Schedule, Quarantine, Inventory, Queue, Settings, and
  Libraries — each with complete German (including confirm dialogs, InfoTip help text, preset
  summaries, and count-aware/pluralised strings). Shared components and the complete YA-WAMF
  language set now use the same contract.
- **Backend-originated messages now participate in i18n.** User-facing JSON errors expose stable
  machine codes while retaining English fallback text for older clients. The typed web client
  translates settings/query validation and filesystem, library, media, queue, exclusion,
  replacement, and integration failures. Queue rows and grouped failure diagnostics use persisted
  failure categories for localized summaries; raw process errors remain available as collapsed,
  explicitly labelled technical detail.
- **Spanish translation.** Spanish joins English and German as a complete selectable locale across
  all 832 message leaves, with YA-WAMF's existing Spanish vocabulary used for shared product terms.
  The frontend completeness check now also compares interpolation placeholders in every locale, so
  a translation that drops or changes runtime tokens such as `{count}`, `{path}`, or `{error}` fails
  `npm run check`.
- **French translation.** French is now selectable and complete across the same 832-message
  contract, including backend error summaries, validation feedback, operational panels, and
  accessibility labels.
- **Italian translation.** Italian is now selectable and complete across the full typed message
  contract, including media terminology, safety guidance, validation, and diagnostics.
- **Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Simplified Chinese translations.** The final four YA-WAMF
  languages are selectable and complete across all 832 message leaves. Ambiguous software terms
  such as media library, processing queue, job, container, candidate, and space saving receive
  context-specific translations rather than literal dictionary meanings. The placeholder audit now
  checks all eight non-English translations, completing parity across `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `it`,
  `ja`, `pt`, `ru`, and `zh` without adding any language to the initial application chunk.
- **Shared-component i18n migration started.** Folder selection, detail-sheet controls, and the
  original/encoded media comparison now use the typed locale contract, including accessible labels,
  loading/empty guidance, playback controls, downloads, and browser compatibility guidance.
  Candidate tables, grouped failure diagnostics/log controls, and the tools/hardware capability
  panel now use the same contract for filters, paging, status, empty states, and accessible actions.
  The preview-transcode comparison completes the shared-component pass: progress/failure states,
  safety guidance, minimised controls, original/encoded labels, sample explanation, technical stats,
  and verification summary all switch live with the selected locale.

- **Unraid Community Applications template.** Added `unraid/optimisarr.xml` (Docker template with
  config/media/work/quarantine volume mappings, the `8787` web port, optional
  `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN`, PUID/PGID/UMASK, and an optional `/dev/dri` device for Intel/AMD
  hardware transcoding), a repository-root `ca_profile.xml` (the profile Community Applications
  requires for a repository submission), and [`docs/setup/unraid.md`](docs/setup/unraid.md) covering
  volume layout, atomic-move guidance for `/trash`, and CPU/Intel/AMD/NVIDIA transcoding on Unraid.

### Fixed

- **Sampled VMAF no longer mistakes seek/decode startup frames for catastrophic quality loss.**
  Each early/middle/late window now seeks both independently encoded inputs five seconds early and
  trims identical decoded pre-roll before resetting timestamps and scoring the requested interval.
  When a hardware-decoded measurement falls below any configured VMAF floor, Optimisarr confirms
  that window through the authoritative software path before rejecting the output or spending time
  on a higher-quality re-encode.
- **Replacement and rollback are crash-safe end to end.** Optimisarr now commits a `Pending`
  rollback record before moving the original, then finalizes it only after the verified output is
  in place. Startup reconciles interrupted records idempotently: it restores a quarantined original
  when the verified output remains in `/work`, or completes the database transition when both file
  moves had already finished. Rollback stages the current optimised file and restores it if moving
  the quarantined original fails, so a failed rollback never leaves the library path empty.
  Quarantine folders also include the job id, preventing concurrent same-named replacements from
  colliding within the same millisecond.
- **Clip-VMAF configuration and translations are complete.** Config export/import now preserves
  the clip-scoring preference. All VMAF settings and presets are translated across the eight
  non-English locales, stale claims that VMAF is enabled by default are corrected, and the locale
  audit now rejects long English prose copied unchanged into a translation.
- **Admin tokens no longer leak through ordinary API query strings.** The `access_token` query
  fallback is limited to SignalR hub paths, where WebSocket clients require it; REST API calls must
  use the bearer header so reverse-proxy logs and browser history do not capture the token. A
  successful bearer request establishes a derived HttpOnly, same-site cookie for native browser
  media elements, keeping authenticated previews working without exposing the configured secret.
- **A retried job no longer keeps a stale failure category.** Starting a new attempt now clears the
  previous attempt's error message and failure classification, so a job that failed once (e.g. a
  verification-gate rejection) and then succeeded on retry is reported as the success it is, instead
  of lingering in the "why jobs fail" diagnostics as a verification failure.
- **The language selector can open in either direction.** Its accessible custom menu measures the
  available viewport space and opens upward near the bottom of the sidebar, while retaining a
  downward menu where there is room. It supports outside-click/Escape dismissal and arrow-key,
  Home, and End navigation. Shared toggle checkboxes now also expose their visible labels to
  assistive technology.
- **VMAF is an opt-in perceptual-quality gate, chosen with a quality slider.** It is off by default
  because it fully decodes both files and scores every frame, which roughly doubles verification
  time and can dominate a run on modest hardware. Each library's policy selector turns it on and
  prefills all floors from five tiers — Space-saver (80/60/30), Balanced (85/70/40), High
  (90/75/45), Visually lossless (93/80/50), and Archival (96/90/70) — with "Off" as the default;
  existing installations retain their effective choice. While it is off the structural, duration and
  size gates plus quarantine rollback still guard every replacement. Remux, audio, and image work
  skip VMAF because it is either redundant or inapplicable, and the final-container smoke test still
  performs a real synthetic `libvmaf` comparison rather than trusting the filter list. Model choice
  and stream preparation are automatic: HDTV/4K selection, reference-resolution bicubic scaling,
  timestamp/timebase and colour-range alignment, and like-for-like HDR-to-SDR reference tone-mapping
  require no libvmaf expertise; reports record the selected policy.
- **Still-image conversion now fails closed around structural loss.** Animated GIF/WebP inputs
  require a proven single frame, TIFF is left untouched while multi-page status cannot be proved,
  and the JPEG target rejects alpha or high-bit-depth inputs. Lossless-to-lossy conversion now
  requires the existing explicit lossy-image opt-in, while PNG/BMP/GIF to WebP uses the encoder's
  genuinely lossless mode. Pixel format and raw bit depth are persisted via a schema migration so
  rescans and queue dispatch make the same decision. AVIF has been withdrawn as an output choice
  because the shipped Jellyfin FFmpeg contains no AVIF encoder (`libaom-av1`); existing AVIF library
  overrides migrate to the proven WebP target, and API/UI choices expose only JPEG and WebP.
- **Music conversion now treats artwork, tags, and lyrics as replacement-critical data.** AAC in
  M4A is the compatibility-first default for art-free music and can retain timed-text lyrics. The
  shipped Jellyfin FFmpeg silently drops inherited M4A cover streams, while Opus needs a picture-
  comment translation it cannot safely perform, so both targets reject attached-art candidates
  before queueing with guidance to choose MP3. MP3/Opus likewise reject timed-lyrics streams they
  cannot contain. Verification now compares
  source/output format tags and embedded-picture counts, and probing persists artwork counts for
  deterministic candidate decisions. Mapped MP3 covers are normalised to broadly supported JPEG
  APIC artwork and explicitly marked `attached_pic`; the final-container smoke test proves this
  against the exact FFmpeg build that performs production transcodes. The UI explains the default
  consistently in every language.
- **Audio bitrate policy is now channel-aware.** The configured value is a stereo baseline;
  retained 5.1/7.1 layouts automatically receive the same budget for each channel pair, while an
  explicit stereo downmix keeps the configured bitrate. Candidate size-saving decisions use that
  effective bitrate too, preventing a lossy surround source from being queued when it cannot save
  space. MP3 rejects more than two retained channels and AAC/Opus reject layouts above their
  supported eight-channel ceiling before FFmpeg runs. Channel counts are persisted by migration.
- **Container CI now exercises the actual media pipelines.** The final image creates and converts
  real synthetic H.264/AAC video, FLAC music with tags and attached JPEG artwork, and opaque/alpha
  PNG fixtures across the production JPEG and WebP targets.
  It runs the production stream-map/codec argument shapes with the shipped Jellyfin FFmpeg, fully
  decodes the video, probes codec/art/tag retention, and byte-compares decoded RGBA frame hashes for
  lossless WebP, and probes and decodes every selectable still format. This complements pure
  command-builder tests with real encoder/muxer coverage.
- **Image verification is now default-on and uses a current SSIM graph.** New installations require
  0.95 SSIM plus EXIF/ICC retention before replacing a still; saved opt-outs remain unchanged. Both
  inputs are independently aligned to explicit reference dimensions, timestamps, full colour range,
  and planar RGB/RGBA without deprecated `scale2ref`, so alpha participates when applicable. ExifTool
  copies source EXIF/ICC before verification while excluding orientation, previews, and stale raster
  dimensions that would misdescribe the encoded pixels. WebP now also rejects high-bit-depth sources
  because its wired encoder path is eight-bit.
- **CRF direction guidance and VMAF availability.** The library video-quality slider now correctly
  labels low CRF values as sharper and high CRF values as smaller. The container no longer assumes
  Jellyfin FFmpeg provides `libvmaf`: it keeps that binary for hardware-aware transcoding and adds a
  digest-pinned, multi-architecture static FFmpeg for perceptual measurements. The image build and
  container smoke test assert the exact `libvmaf` filter (without mistaking `vmafmotion` for it), and
  Settings → Tools reports the measurement binary as an optional capability without making core
  readiness depend on an opt-in quality gate.
- **A/V sync verification no longer false-fails sources with an inherent audio-start offset.** The
  gate previously checked the *output's* absolute video-vs-audio start divergence (>0.5 s = fail),
  so a source that legitimately carries a baked-in audio delay — e.g. a Bluray rip whose AC3 track
  starts ~1 s after video — failed verification on every episode even though the transcode preserved
  the timing exactly, blocking optimisation of whole seasons (observed live on a Stargate SG-1 S2
  release). The check is now **relative**: when the original's stream start times are known it
  compares the *change* the transcode made to the A/V offset and fails only when that change exceeds
  the 0.5 s tolerance — so a faithfully-preserved offset passes, while a transcode that shifts sync
  (or drops an inherent delay) still fails. Falls back to the previous absolute check when the
  original's start times can't be read. `VerificationInput` gains `OriginalVideoStartSeconds` /
  `OriginalAudioStartSeconds`, populated from the original probe.
- **Preview VMAF now compares the same source window frame-for-frame.** The encoded preview used an
  accurate decode seek, while its stream-copied reference could retain frames from the preceding
  keyframe; libvmaf then compared different moments and reported near-zero, CRF-insensitive scores.
  Preview measurement now seeks and decodes the full original as libvmaf's reference input, while
  `shortest` bounds it to the encoded sample. Final-container CI starts deliberately between
  keyframes and requires the resulting ordinary CRF encode to score at least 90.
- **Video timing now follows probe evidence instead of forcing MP4 to CFR.** The earlier blanket
  `-fps_mode cfr` response to live job 3334 could duplicate/drop frames and alter motion cadence.
  Probing now compares nominal and average frame rate (with a rounding tolerance) and persists a
  nullable VFR decision. Positively identified VFR re-encodes use `-fps_mode vfr` plus the demuxer
  encoder timebase in every container; CFR and unknown sources receive no frame-rate override, and
  remuxes are never re-timed. Timestamp-integrity, tail, duration, and relative A/V-sync verification
  remain the fail-closed backstops. Migration `TrackVariableFrameRate`.
- **Video verification now checks the encoded signal structure.** Replacement requires the resolved
  target codec (or unchanged codec/profile for a remux), exact source resolution, no reduction in
  pixel bit depth or chroma sampling, and a reported profile consistent with high-bit-depth output.
  These checks catch silent 10→8-bit, 4:4:4→4:2:0, resize, wrong-codec, and missing-profile outcomes
  that a clean decode or good VMAF score cannot prove. ffprobe profiles are persisted via
  `TrackVideoProfile`, unit tests cover each failure class, and container CI probes the real HEVC
  output's dimensions, format, and profile.
- **Compatibility video profiles now include compatible audio by default.** Balanced HEVC/MP4 and
  Compatibility H.264/MP4 re-encode audio to channel-aware AAC at a 160 kbps stereo baseline, so
  “plays everywhere” describes the whole file rather than only its video stream. Surround layout is
  retained with scaled bitrate; there is no implicit downmix. Advanced now distinguishes “Profile
  default” from an explicit “Copy” override, which remains available for operators who require
  bit-exact source audio. AV1/MKV and remux profiles continue to copy by default.
- **Every production media pass now uses one configured toolchain.** Probing, timestamp inspection,
  decode verification, hardware detection, and transcoding share the configured Jellyfin
  FFmpeg/ffprobe pair instead of mixing it with Debian's PATH binaries. Custom installations can
  set `OPTIMISARR_FFPROBE`; otherwise an absolute `OPTIMISARR_FFMPEG` path automatically resolves
  its sibling probe. The final-container smoke suite exercises that exact configured pair.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-07-05

### Safety — edge-case hardening

- **Dolby Vision sources are now left untouched by default.** DV carries a dynamic-metadata RPU that
  cannot survive a re-encode; without it the file degrades to HDR10/SDR, and a Profile 5 source (no
  HDR10 base layer) comes out green/pink. With the perceptual (VMAF) gate off by default there was no
  backstop, so a DV source could be transcoded to a colour-shifted output and still pass verification,
  replacing the original. The probe now detects Dolby Vision distinctly (DOVI side-data or a
  `dvhe`/`dvh1`/`dav1` codec tag), and the candidate evaluator skips DV sources regardless of the HDR
  setting unless a per-library **Optimise Dolby Vision** opt-in is enabled (off by default; settable
  in the library form and preserved across config backup/restore). Migration `AddDolbyVisionHandling`.

- **MP4 falls back to MKV when the audio can't be muxed.** Copying a Blu-ray audio format MP4 has no
  tag for (Dolby TrueHD, Blu-ray/DVD LPCM) into an MP4 target aborts the encode. The resolver now
  falls back to MKV in that case — the same proven pattern as image-based subtitles — but only when the
  audio is being copied; a library that re-encodes audio to a compatible codec keeps its MP4 target.

- **Timestamp and hardware-stream robustness.** Every video job now regenerates presentation
  timestamps (`-fflags +genpts`) so a source with missing or non-monotonic DTS muxes cleanly instead
  of warning or aborting (a no-op when timestamps are valid). And a hardware encode (QSV/VAAPI/NVENC)
  now drops data streams (camera timecode, GoPro GPMF) even for a Matroska output — previously dropped
  only for MP4 — since a hardware encoder can abort on one whatever the container.

### UI

- **The compare preview starts at the middle of the file.** In the Quarantine compare-to-approve
  panel (and the Settings preview it shares), both the original and encoded video previews now seek to
  their midpoint once metadata loads, so the operator lands on a representative frame instead of the
  black leader at the start.

- **A "Play both" button starts the two compare viewers together.** In the same compare panel
  (Quarantine and the shared Settings preview), one control now plays or pauses the original and
  encoded viewers at once, so they can be compared in motion without juggling two sets of controls.
  The toggle reflects the real element state, so using a viewer's own controls keeps the label honest.

### Build

- **Pinned `Microsoft.OpenApi` to 2.9.0 to clear a security advisory.** The 2.0.0 pulled in
  transitively by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` is flagged by NuGet audit (GHSA-v5pm-xwqc-g5wc,
  `NU1903`: a circular schema reference can trigger a stack overflow), which the CI backend build
  promotes to an error via `-warnaserror` — failing the build on a clean restore. Added a direct
  reference at 2.9.0 (latest on the patched 2.x line; the fix first shipped in 2.7.5).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-28

### Security

- **Admin-token auth is now covered by end-to-end tests.** A real HTTP host (with the token configured)
  asserts that every destructive or secret-bearing endpoint — settings read/save/export/import, library
  create/delete/enqueue, job clear/cancel/retry/remove/replace, replacement rollback/approve, and the
  diagnostics bundle — is rejected with `401` when the token is missing or wrong, that `/api/health`,
  `/api/ready`, and `/api/auth/status` stay open, and that a valid token passes. The auth enforcement is
  now proven at the pipeline level, not just in the matcher unit tests.

### API contract

- **The generated OpenAPI document is now self-describing.** A titled, versioned, described info
  block; every operation is grouped under an area tag (`System`, `Settings`, `Libraries`, `Inventory`,
  `Queue`, `Replacements`, `Integrations`, `Realtime`) so API browsers and client generators render a
  navigable contract; and every admin-token-protected operation now documents its `401` response while
  the open endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`, `/api/auth/status`) correctly do not. Generated by a
  single document transformer; `docs/openapi.json` regenerated.

### Pipeline robustness

- **A queued job is re-checked for eligibility just before it transcodes.** A job can sit in a long
  backlog while the library's rules tighten (e.g. the already-efficient-source floor is added) or the
  file gains an optimised sibling — previously such a job still ran and was only caught by the
  size-saving gate after wasting an encode. The dispatcher now re-evaluates the file against the
  current rules first (the shared `CandidateService` logic: rule decision, optimised-sibling skip, and
  explicit exclusions — but not the job-history overlay, so a retry still runs) and, when the file is
  no longer a candidate, marks the job `Cancelled` with the reason ("Skipped before encoding: …")
  instead of transcoding. Previews always run. This closes the gap that let pre-floor Breaking Bad
  episodes re-encode to a larger file and fail.

- **Rollback now fails safely when the quarantined original is gone.** A regression test proves that
  if the quarantined original has been purged or lost, a rollback returns a clear failure and leaves
  the in-place optimised file untouched (instead of deleting it and losing both copies) — completing
  the pipeline robustness pass, whose FFmpeg stream/container permutations, replacement state
  transitions, and candidate decisions are now all covered by adversarial tests.

### UI

- **The candidate table now pages a large library one screen at a time.** The shared candidate table
  (the fleet-wide Candidates page and the per-library Candidates tab) renders 100 rows per page with a
  range readout and prev/next controls, and resets to page one when the all/eligible/skipped filter
  changes — the same client-side paging the Queue table uses, so a library with thousands of probed
  files stays responsive instead of rendering every row.

- **Detail-sheet layout polish.** In the Queue detail sheet the box art now sits to the right of the
  technical detail and verification report (a clean left-info / right-art body) instead of being wedged
  above the progress bar. In the Inventory detail sheet the faded poster backdrop now spans the whole
  sheet — `BottomSheet` gained an optional ambient `backdrop` layer rendered behind the header and the
  full content, clipped to the panel — instead of being trapped inside the scrolling details panel.
  The backdrop is tuned to the Queue hero's intensity (a directional fade that keeps the labels
  readable on the left while the poster shows through on the right) so it is actually visible rather
  than washed out.

### Diagnostics & observability

- **The media/inventory API now exposes the optimisation marker.** `GET /api/media` and `/api/inventory`
  rows carry `optimisedMarker` — the Optimisarr version stamped into a file when Optimisarr produced it,
  or null for a source. This lets a client tell an optimised output apart from an original (and which
  version made it) without inspecting the file, closing a gap that previously required filesystem access
  to diagnose a replacement collision.

### UI

- **Inventory shows the filename, with the full path in the detail sheet.** The Inventory list now
  shows each file's name instead of its full library path (the path is still the hover title); opening
  a row shows the filename and the full relative path in the detail header, over a faded, blurred
  poster backdrop (like the Queue hero) that stays silent when no artwork resolves.
- **The Queue detail sheet shows larger box art.** Clicking a queue row now shows a larger poster of
  the title beside the job's progress and details, as a recognition aid.
- **The sidebar shows the running version alongside the build's git hash** (e.g. `v0.2.0 · a7283c3`).
  The version comes from `/api/health` — the same assembly version stamped into the `optimisarr=<version>`
  marker on optimised files — so what the UI reports always matches what the backend writes. It falls
  back to just the hash if the version can't be read.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-27

### Eligibility

- **A per-library "Skip already-efficient sources" toggle.** The efficiency floor that skips sources
  already too compressed to shrink is on by default per the library's preset, and can now be turned
  off per library (Libraries → video settings) to send every eligible file to the encoder anyway — the
  size-saving gate still protects the original. Settings backups carry the toggle. Migration
  `AddLibrarySkipEfficientSources` (existing libraries keep the floor on).

### Maintainability

- **`Program.cs` is now a composition root, not a 2,000-line endpoint file.** All 72 endpoints live in
  nine focused `Endpoints/*.cs` extension methods (settings, integration, exclusion, health, system,
  library, stats, replacement, and media/queue), mapped from a `Program.cs` trimmed from 1,960 to 418
  lines that now holds only service registration, startup, middleware, and the endpoint-group calls.
  The few endpoints that need startup locals (the admin token, the config directory) take them as
  method parameters, and the range-aware file server is a shared `FileServing` helper. A pure move —
  no route, name, or behaviour change — verified by the byte-identical generated OpenAPI document and
  the full test suite.

### Scalability

- **The Queue table renders one page at a time.** A large queue (thousands of jobs) previously
  rendered every row into the DOM at once. The table now pages 100 rows at a time with prev/next
  controls and a "showing X–Y of Z" line; the filter chips still count the whole set, and the
  live current-work hero is unaffected.

- **The Inventory page paginates on the server instead of downloading the whole library.** A new
  `GET /api/inventory` returns one page of files already paired with their rule verdict, plus the
  filtered total and the per-filter tallies (all/eligible/skipped/unprobed). The Inventory page now
  fetches a single page (50 rows) and drives its filter chips, counts, and pager from the server, so a
  library with thousands of files renders a page at a time rather than loading every row and every
  candidate into the browser. The rule evaluation stays pure logic over the probed inventory, so it is
  cheap even for a large library.

- **The inventory list paginates and filters in the database.** `GET /api/media` now accepts
  `status`, `search` (a case-insensitive path substring), and `page`/`pageSize`; the body stays a
  media array (existing callers are unaffected) and the pre-paging total is returned in the
  `X-Total-Count` header. Filtering, counting, ordering, and paging all run in SQL, and a new
  `(LibraryId, RelativePath)` index lets a large library page without a table sort — so Inventory stays
  responsive with tens of thousands of files. Migration `AddMediaFileLibraryPathIndex`.

### Security

- **Optional built-in admin token.** Set `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN` to require a bearer token for
  protected API calls and the SignalR jobs hub. The SPA shell stays loadable so it can show a token
  prompt; `/api/health`, `/api/ready`, and `/api/auth/status` remain open for health checks and
  discovery. Browser media previews append the token as `access_token` because native media requests
  cannot send custom authorization headers. Reverse-proxy authentication remains the recommended
  boundary for internet-exposed instances.

### API contract

- **The OpenAPI document is now generated and checked in CI.** `docs/openapi.json` is generated from
  the running API, and CI fails if the checked-in contract drifts. The documentation checker also
  verifies every method/path listed in `docs/api.md` exists in the generated spec, so the human API
  reference can no longer silently document missing endpoints.

### Test coverage

- **Pipeline robustness coverage now includes more MP4-family edge cases.** FFmpeg command tests cover
  `.mp4`, `.m4v`, and `.mov` subtitle conversion plus attachment/data stream exclusion, and `.m4a`/
  `.m4b` metadata handling for audio outputs. Transcode-spec tests also confirm image-based subtitles
  fall back from every MP4-family video container to MKV while MKV targets stay unchanged.
- **Replacement now has coverage for a vanished original.** When the original is deleted or renamed
  between verification and replacement (e.g. a Sonarr/Radarr upgrade), replacement fails permanently
  without creating anything, retains the verified output, records nothing, and saves no lifetime
  bytes — so the reconcile sweep fails the job once instead of retrying it forever. This closes the
  one untested branch in the destructive replacement path.

### Diagnostics & observability

- **Admin diagnostics snapshot at `GET /api/diagnostics`.** One authenticated call returns the version,
  environment (OS, framework, config path and writability), global settings, tool (FFmpeg/ffprobe) and
  hardware-encoder capability, per-library summaries (with file counts), integration summaries,
  dashboard stats, the failure summary, and the most recent captured ffmpeg logs — enough to file a
  support issue from API evidence alone. It is assembled only from non-secret data: provider tokens,
  API keys, and webhook URLs (which can embed a secret) are never included, enforced by a single pure
  redaction step and verified against real data. The endpoint is under `/api`, so the admin token
  protects it when one is set.

- **The job and failure queries take filters and paging.** `GET /api/jobs` now accepts `libraryId`,
  `category` (a failure category), and `since`/`until` (bounding a job's finished/enqueued time), plus
  `page` and `pageSize`; the body stays a `JobDto` array and the pre-paging total is returned in the
  `X-Total-Count` header, so existing callers are unaffected. `GET /api/jobs/failures` accepts a
  `libraryId` to scope the summary to one library. SQL-translatable filters run in the database; the
  date filter and ordering run in memory (SQLite can't order or compare a `DateTimeOffset`).

- **The Queue page has a Failures tab.** Rather than a new sidebar entry, failed jobs are grouped by
  reason on a tab beside the live queue, so job views stay in one place and the sidebar stays lean.
  Each group shows its plain-language reason, a count, and recent jobs; "View log" expands the
  captured ffmpeg log inline. Reads the diagnostics endpoints below, so "why did it fail?" is
  answerable in the UI without container access.

- **Failed transcodes are now answerable from the API.** `GET /api/jobs` accepts a `status` filter
  (e.g. `?status=Failed`) so callers no longer fetch every job and filter client-side, and a new
  `GET /api/jobs/failures` groups failed jobs by a classified reason — size-saving gate, container
  incompatibility, image-based subtitles, replacement collision, source/output missing, verification,
  or other — with a count and recent samples (job id, path, error) per group, largest first. The
  classification is a pure, shared `FailureClassifier`, so the same buckets drive the API and, in
  future, the UI. This makes "why are jobs failing?" answerable without reading container logs.

- **A failed transcode now keeps its ffmpeg log, served at `GET /api/jobs/{id}/log`.** When ffmpeg
  exits non-zero, its substantive stderr — stream mapping, warnings, and the error that ended the run
  — is captured (the thousands of progress frames are filtered out, and a very long log keeps its head
  and tail with the middle elided) and stored on the job. The endpoint returns it as plain text, or
  404 when a job has none. The rich "Could not find tag for codec none…" detail that previously lived
  only in container logs is now one request away.

- **A job's failure category is stored when it fails, not re-derived on every read.** The classified
  reason is written to a new `FailureCategory` column the moment a job fails, so the failure summary
  groups in the database and the class stays stable even if the message is later edited (older rows
  fall back to classifying the message). The category is also surfaced per job on `GET /api/jobs`, so
  the queue can label a failure by its kind. Migration `AddJobFailureCategory`.

### Eligibility

- **Sources already too efficiently encoded to shrink are skipped before transcoding.** A video whose
  bitrate is already very low for its resolution (e.g. a ~1.6 Mbps 1080p h264 episode) cannot be made
  meaningfully smaller by re-encoding, so it used to transcode and then fail the size-saving
  verification gate — burning GPU/CPU time for nothing. Profiles now carry an efficiency floor
  (bits per pixel-second, so it holds across resolutions and frame rates) and skip such a source up
  front with the reason "Already efficiently encoded (~X.X Mbps at 1080p) — re-encoding is unlikely to
  save space". The floor is conservative and uses the total-file bitrate (which overstates the video
  bitrate), so it only skips clear cases; the size-saving gate remains the backstop. HEVC and H.264
  profiles set a floor; AV1 sets none, as it can shrink even low-bitrate sources.

- **A file whose optimised copy already sits beside it is no longer re-transcoded.** When an
  Optimisarr-produced output (e.g. an hevc `.mp4`) remains next to its original (e.g. the h264
  `.mkv`) — left by a cleared replacement history, a move-on-complete, or a separate re-import — the
  original was still rule-eligible and would be transcoded again, only to be refused at replacement
  time because the destination is occupied. The candidate and enqueue paths now detect the marked
  sibling (same library, same path stem) and skip the original up front with the reason "An optimised
  copy already exists alongside this file", so no GPU/CPU time is spent on an encode that can never be
  applied. Only the unmarked original is held back; the optimised copy itself is unaffected.

### Replacement reliability

- **A permanently blocked auto-replace now fails the job once instead of retrying forever.** When a
  verified `ReadyToReplace` job can never be applied — the destination is already occupied by a
  different optimised file, the verified output has vanished from `/work`, or the original is gone —
  the reconcile sweep marked it with a warning and left it `ReadyToReplace`, so it was re-attempted on
  every cycle and flooded the logs. These unrecoverable outcomes are now classified as permanent and
  the job is failed once. The original is still never touched. Because the job becomes terminally
  failed, the file is also skipped by the "previously failed" overlay and counts toward auto-exclusion,
  so it is no longer re-queued and re-transcoded on each scan.

### Transcode reliability

- **MP4 outputs no longer abort on Matroska attachment or data streams.** A re-encode or remux to an
  MP4-family container (`.mp4`/`.m4v`/`.mov`) now excludes attachment (`-0:t`) and data (`-0:d`)
  streams, which MP4 cannot mux. Previously a source carrying an embedded font or cover-art
  attachment — reported by ffmpeg as `Could not find tag for codec none in stream #N` — failed the
  whole job before a frame was written. The original was always left untouched, but the file could
  never be optimised. Matroska outputs still keep these streams via the blanket stream copy.

### Preview clip mode

- **Video previews now verify the same middle sample they encode.** Long video previews still encode
  a 60-second segment from the middle of the source for fast turnaround, but verification now creates
  a temporary clipped reference from that same window before running duration, stream, size, VMAF,
  loudness, timestamp, and tail checks. The compare panel labels clipped verification as
  segment-only and keeps the saving estimate based on the sample bitrate.

### Release hardening

- **Dry-run mode is now available from Settings → General → Replacement.** Optimisarr can still scan,
  queue, transcode, verify, and preview normally, but manual replacement, auto-replace, and
  quarantine purge are blocked while dry-run mode is on. Verified outputs stop at
  `ReadyToReplace` for review, and rollback remains available for existing replacements because it
  restores protected originals.
- **Configuration import is stricter and transactional.** Backup imports now reject malformed image
  downscale modes/values and auto-enqueue windows instead of silently coercing them to defaults, and
  the whole import runs inside one database transaction so settings and definitions are applied
  together or not at all.
- **Backup restore feedback now includes Sonarr/Radarr connections.** The Settings UI reports imported
  download-manager connections and reloads that section after import instead of leaving stale data on
  screen.
- **The test suite now includes an EF migration smoke test.** It applies all migrations to an empty
  SQLite database and asserts no pending migrations remain, covering the real migration chain
  separately from `EnsureCreated`-based unit tests.
- **Release docs are safer for first-run users.** The quickstart now walks through compose selection,
  writable mounts, readiness checks, dry-run-first operation, and authenticated reverse-proxy
  exposure. Troubleshooting now covers dry-run replacement blocks, readiness failures, config import
  validation, and stale UI after image updates; the security policy spells out that the UI is an
  administrative surface and exports contain secrets.
- **Synthetic-media integration coverage has started.** A hermetic test now creates synthetic media
  files, scans them through the real inventory service, applies synthetic ffprobe JSON through the
  parser, and verifies candidate decisions through the real candidate service.
- **The roadmap now reflects existing GHCR publishing.** CI already builds the production container,
  runs the container readiness smoke test, and publishes GHCR images on non-PR branch/tag builds.
- **CI avoids duplicate Docker builds.** The Docker job now builds the production image once,
  smoke-tests that exact image, and pushes the same local tags on non-PR runs, keeping release
  hardening inside standard GitHub-hosted public-repo CI.

### Custom mode for a library's video preset

- **Setting your own codec/container is now a first-class "Custom" choice, not a warning.** The
  optimisation slider gains a **Custom** stop at the end (kept on the same control for consistency).
  Selecting it — or changing the codec/container in Advanced, which moves the slider to Custom
  automatically — is treated as a deliberate configuration: the amber "Overridden" badge and caution
  box are replaced by a calm, neutral note explaining that the slider now just sets the baseline for
  anything you leave on "Profile default." Dragging back to a preset stop clears the overrides. No
  data change — "Custom" is derived from the existing override fields, so nothing new is stored.

### Library Advanced panel spacing

- **The first section in a library's Advanced options no longer hugs the top divider.** The leading
  section (e.g. "Video" for Film/TV) had its top padding stripped, so its heading sat tight against
  the drawer border; it now gets the same breathing room as the other sections.

### Media thumbnails in the Inventory and Candidates lists

- **Every row now shows a thumbnail** (on the Inventory page and the per-library Candidates tab) so you
  can recognise an item at a glance instead of parsing a filename. The thumbnail is chosen by kind:
  - **Film/TV → poster** from a connected **Radarr/Sonarr first** (an exact, local match keyed to the
    imported file; TV rows show the series poster), falling back to a media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby).
  - **Music → the file's embedded cover art**, extracted with ffmpeg — no external service needed.
  - **Images → a down-scaled still** of the image itself, rendered with ffmpeg.
- All bytes are produced/proxied by the backend, so no server/API token ever reaches the browser;
  thumbnails lazy-load into a fixed box (no layout shift) and fall back silently to a plain
  placeholder. ffmpeg extraction runs with a timeout and a short negative cache so a list scroll never
  respawns it for a cover-less file. New reusable `<Thumbnail>` component and `GET
  /api/media/{id}/thumbnail` endpoint (replacing the film-only poster endpoint).
- Artwork is a **recognition aid, not decoration**: it lazy-loads into a fixed 2:3 box (no layout
  shift), degrades silently to a plain placeholder when nothing resolves, and never implies state.
  Audio/image candidates show no poster. New reusable `<Poster>` component and `GET
  /api/media/{id}/poster` endpoint; the existing Queue-hero backdrop is unchanged.

### Upgraded/renamed source files no longer leave phantom candidates and failing jobs

- **A scan now retires inventory rows whose file has vanished.** When Radarr/Sonarr upgrade a
  release and rename the file (e.g. `… WEBDL-1080p.mkv` → `… Bluray-1080p.mkv`), the new file is
  discovered but the old path used to linger forever as a phantom candidate — and any job already
  queued against it failed with a bare ffmpeg `No such file or directory`. The scan now removes a row
  whose file is genuinely gone from disk (a settled file merely skipped this pass is kept), cascading
  away its now-meaningless jobs. Rows with replacement history are never pruned, so rollback records
  survive. The reconcile stays idempotent: scanning an unchanged library removes nothing.
- **A job whose source has disappeared now fails fast with a clear reason.** Before transcoding, the
  worker checks the source still exists; if it was moved/upgraded it stops immediately with
  "Source file no longer exists … re-scan the library" instead of spinning up the hardware encoder
  only to hit a raw ffmpeg error.

### Concurrent auto-replace no longer strands a job and loses its output

- **Fixed a race where two replacements ran on the same job at once, destroying the verified
  output.** A job becomes replaceable the instant it reaches `ReadyToReplace`, and two callers
  competed for it — the worker's post-verify auto-replace and the background auto-replace reconcile
  sweep (a manual replace could join too). Because a same-container replacement puts the output back
  at the original's own path, the overlapping move sequences corrupted each other: one moved the
  output into place while the other quarantined what it found there, the final-path integrity check
  tripped, and both runs restored the original from quarantine. The safety model held — **the
  original was always preserved** — but the verified output in `/work` was deleted, leaving the job
  stuck in `ReadyToReplace` forever while the reconcile retried every few seconds. Replacement is now
  serialised per job by a process-wide claim (`ReplacementCoordinator`): the first caller wins and
  the rest back off, so only one replacement ever touches a job.
- **A `ReadyToReplace` job whose verified output has vanished from `/work` is now failed, not retried
  forever.** Such a job can never be replaced (the output is gone), so the reconcile sweep now marks
  it `Failed` with a "re-run the optimisation" message instead of looping and burying real warnings.
  The original is untouched — replacement bails before quarantining when the output is missing.
- **Quieter logs:** Entity Framework's per-query `Database.Command` logging is now at `Warning`, so a
  steady background sweep no longer floods the container log with full SQL on every cycle.

### Queue detail sheet shows the FFmpeg command

- **Clicking the job that's encoding no longer just repeats the hero panel.** The live CPU/GPU usage
  graph now appears only in the "now encoding" hero; the detail sheet instead shows the exact FFmpeg
  command for the job (and points to the hero for live usage), which is also handy for diagnosing a
  failed job.

### Exclude files from optimisation

- **You can now exclude individual files so they are never optimised again.** From a failed/stuck
  job in the Queue, hit **Exclude** — the file is added to a durable, path-keyed exclusion list and
  the failed attempt is cleared. Excluded files are skipped by scans, the candidate list, and
  auto-optimise. Each library has an **Excluded** tab listing its exclusions, where you can remove
  one to make the file eligible again. Unlike the soft "previously failed" skip (which hangs off a
  job row and disappears when the queue history is cleared), an exclusion survives clearing the
  queue, re-scanning, and re-adding the library. Your original files are never touched.
- **Files that keep failing are now excluded automatically.** After three terminal failures of a
  file's current version it is auto-excluded, so it stops burning encode time and instead surfaces
  on the Excluded tab for review (a successful encode resets the streak). The tab distinguishes
  automatic exclusions (amber, "repeated failures") from manual ones with an icon, and removing one
  resets the file's failure count so it gets a genuine fresh start.

### Decode-health no longer fails on hardware-encoder timestamp noise

- **A verified hardware-encoded output is no longer rejected for muxer DTS warnings.** The decode-
  health check decodes to the null muxer, which is stricter about timestamps than any player; a
  hardware encoder (e.g. `hevc_qsv`, NVENC) can emit equal/duplicate DTS that the muxer reports as
  "non monotonically increasing dts to muxer" — once per packet. These were being counted as decode
  errors (tens of thousands of them), failing verification on an otherwise-perfect encode. They are a
  muxing remark about the throwaway decode output, not picture corruption — genuine decode-order
  regressions are still judged by the separate timestamp-integrity gate — so they are now excluded
  from the decode-error tally. Real decode errors (corrupt frames, packet read errors) still count.

### "Scott's Settings" optimisation preset

- **A new "Scott's Settings" preset** on the library optimisation slider (Film/TV): conservative
  HEVC (H.265) in MP4 at CRF 24, HDR preserved, and audio re-encoded to AAC 96 kbps downmixed to
  stereo — a compatibility-first, space-saving bundle. It preserves HDR rather than defaulting to
  HDR-to-SDR tone mapping, avoiding the CPU-heavy software tone-map path while retaining the source
  signal. Selecting it fills the matching Advanced fields so the panel honestly shows what it does
  (the stereo downmix in particular is an explicit per-library switch). A music library set to this
  profile gets the same AAC 96 kbps stereo target.

### Re-encode oversized files already in the target codec

- **A new per-library option to re-encode large files that already match the target codec** (e.g. a
  huge HEVC remux under an HEVC preset). Off by default; when enabled, same-codec files at or above a
  configurable size (default 20 GB) become eligible so they can be shrunk, while smaller ones are
  still left untouched. The size-saving verification gate still rejects any output that doesn't get
  smaller, so the original is never lost.

### Libraries settings: cleaner, more polished form

- **Advanced options are now a distinct tinted "drawer"** — a bordered, rounded card with its own
  header band, clearly set apart from the simple controls above. Sub-section titles (Video, Audio,
  Eligibility…) are crisp uppercase labels, and the dense per-field helper text has been moved into
  hover tooltips across every section (matching the Settings page) for an easier-to-navigate form.
- **Library cards show a friendly preset name** ("Scott's Settings", "Conservative HEVC") instead of
  the raw PascalCase profile id.

### Dashboard: durable lifetime savings + live system usage

- **"Total space saved" is now a persistent lifetime total, not a figure derived from current rows.**
  Previously the headline summed the surviving `Replacement` rows, so it silently shrank whenever
  those rows went away — a quarantine purge, clearing queue/replacement history, or removing a
  library — and read as zero against a fresh database. It now accrues in durable `AppSetting`
  counters as each replacement is put in place (and is reversed when one is rolled back), so it
  survives restarts and history changes and reflects realised lifetime savings. A **Reset** control
  on the card (two-step confirm) zeroes it via `POST /api/stats/clear`; this only clears the headline
  figure and touches no files, quarantine, or rollback history.
- **The Dashboard now shows the live CPU/GPU usage graph** while a job is encoding, reusing the same
  unprivileged SignalR telemetry as the Queue view (idle hint when nothing is encoding).

### Safer replacement (hardening)

- **A cross-filesystem replacement copy is now verified by SHA-256 content, not just byte length.**
  The copy-plus-delete fallback used when an atomic rename isn't possible across mounts previously
  accepted any same-length copy; it now confirms the destination is a bit-for-bit duplicate of the
  source before the original is removed, so a truncated or corrupted copy can never stand in for it.
- **A failed replacement can no longer strand the original in quarantine.** If an output move fails
  partway and leaves a remnant at the destination — including the original's own path when the
  container is unchanged — restore now clears that disposable remnant before moving the protected
  original back, instead of skipping the restore because the path looked occupied.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-22

First tagged release.

### Dashboard reworked around outcomes

- **The Dashboard now leads with what Optimisarr has achieved**, replacing the stale placeholder
  pipeline card (which wrongly claimed only Discover/Probe were active). A new `GET /api/stats`
  endpoint aggregates the figures server-side:
  - **Total space saved** (headline) — realised savings across every file whose optimised version is
    in place, with original→optimised totals and the size-weighted average reduction. Rolled-back
    replacements correctly count as zero saving.
  - **Queue** (running / queued / failed), **Awaiting review** (in quarantine + reclaimable space),
    **Ready to replace**, and **Libraries** (enabled + files discovered) — each a shortcut to its
    page.
  - A **system-health** strip (service + media tools + jobs in flight).
  Aggregation is unit-tested; the page refreshes every 15s.

### Stale UI after a deploy fixed

- **`index.html` is now served with `no-cache`, and the content-hashed assets with a one-year
  immutable cache.** Previously the SPA entry point could be cached by the browser, so after pulling
  a new image users kept loading the previous deploy's asset hashes and never saw the new UI without
  a manual hard-refresh. New deploys are now picked up automatically.

### Preview can be minimised

- **The optimisation preview (Inventory → Preview) can now be minimised** to a small floating widget
  while its throwaway transcode runs, so the rest of the UI stays usable instead of being blocked by
  the full-screen panel. The widget shows live status ("Encoding 42%", "Ready", etc.); Expand
  restores the full comparison. Clicking away or pressing Escape now minimises rather than discards —
  only the explicit Close stops the preview and deletes its output.

### Quarantine: shared detail sheet + clear finished

- **The compare-to-approve review now opens in the shared bottom sheet** (with the table shrinking to
  keep rows reachable), instead of expanding a row in place — matching Inventory and the Queue.
  Clicking a "Replaced" row opens the original-vs-replacement comparison, verification report, and
  the approve / roll-back actions.
- **New "Clear finished" button** removes spent quarantine entries (rolled back + purged) from the
  list via `POST /api/replacements/clear`. These are terminal history with no rollback left, so
  clearing them only declutters — active "Replaced" entries are always kept and never touched.

### Verification page folded into the Queue

- **Removed the standalone Verification page** (and its sidebar entry). It was a filtered view of the
  same job data the Queue already shows, with the same detail sheet and gate report. The Queue gains
  **"Verified" and "Verification failed" filter chips** so you can still slice by verification
  outcome (which cuts across job status — a ready-to-replace job has passed; a job can fail a gate
  without being a hard failure). One less page to navigate for the same information.

### Cover art no longer fails the encode

- **Files with embedded cover art / poster thumbnails now optimise instead of failing.** A remux
  often carries several mjpeg/png "video" streams (attached pictures). The old `-map 0 -c:v <enc>`
  routed those tiny stills through the hardware encoder, which rejects them with `-22 (Invalid
  argument)` and aborts the whole job ("Could not open encoder before EOF" → nothing written). The
  builder now copies every stream by default and re-encodes only the primary video (`-c copy` +
  `-c:v:0`/`-filter:v:0`), so cover art, attachments and data are preserved untouched. Verified
  live against a Remux with four embedded covers.

### Queue hero & dispatch tidy-up

- The "now processing" hero shows the **file name as the title with the folder path as a small
  subtitle**, instead of the whole path as the heading.
- The steady-state "Dispatch ready · N running · work free" line is **removed** — dispatch state is
  now surfaced only when it needs attention (paused, or a backlog waiting on a closed library
  window).

### Discord notifications

- **Discord is now a first-class notification type** in Settings → Notifications, posting a native
  embed (title + description) so messages render properly. The type was supported by the backend but
  missing from the UI dropdown, so it couldn't be selected.
- **A "Webhook" target pointed at a Discord webhook URL now works automatically.** Discord rejects
  the generic `{ event, title, body }` webhook body with HTTP 400; the builder now detects a Discord
  webhook URL (discord.com / discordapp.com `/api/webhooks/`) under either the Discord or the generic
  Webhook type and sends an embed instead — so existing misconfigured targets start working without
  being recreated. Detection is pure and unit-tested.

### Auto-replace now applies retrospectively

- **Turning on a library's "Replace automatically when verified" now also applies to jobs already
  waiting in ReadyToReplace** — not just jobs that verify afterwards. Previously auto-replace was
  evaluated only inline at the moment a job finished verifying, so a job that became ready before the
  toggle was enabled (or was left ready by a transient replace failure) sat there forever needing a
  manual Replace. A periodic reconciliation pass in the dispatch loop now picks up any verified
  ReadyToReplace job whose library auto-replaces and replaces it (bounded per cycle). The original is
  still quarantined with a recorded rollback first, so the safety model is unchanged; a failure
  leaves the job ready to retry next cycle. The rule is a pure, unit-tested `AutoReplacePolicy`.

### Queue: reset button + "waiting for window" reason

- **New "Clear queue" action** resets the pending backlog in one click — removes every Queued and
  ReadyToReplace job and stops anything in flight (`POST /api/jobs/clear-pending`). Useful after a
  rules change. **No original is ever touched:** ReadyToReplace jobs hold only a verified,
  not-yet-applied output (no replacement, no rollback), so the reset discards recomputable work,
  never data; their `/work` outputs are cleaned up to reclaim space. Distinct from "Clear errored"
  and "Clear completed", which only remove terminal history.
- **The Queue now explains an idle backlog.** When dispatch is ready but nothing starts because
  every queued job's library auto-optimise window is shut, the Queue shows e.g. *"1605 job(s)
  waiting for the TV optimise window (00:00–05:00)"* instead of appearing stuck. The new
  `queue/status.waitingReason` is computed by a pure, unit-tested `QueueWaitReason`.

### Queue hero artwork backdrop

- The "now processing" hero shows a faint **backdrop image** of the title being encoded, pulled from
  the first connected media server (Plex `art`, Jellyfin/Emby backdrop) and **proxied** server-side
  so the browser never sees the token. The file path is parsed to a title/year
  (`MediaTitleParser`), the server is searched (`ArtworkSearchParser`), and the resolved URL is
  cached. Fully optional and graceful: no connected server, no match, or a music/photo job simply
  shows the plain hero. All matching/parsing logic is pure and unit-tested.
- **Fix: Plex backdrops never resolved.** Plex's plain `/search?query=` returns only search
  *providers* (no `Metadata`) on current server versions, so the lookup always came back empty. The
  service now queries `/hubs/search`, and `ArtworkSearchParser` reads results from both the
  top-level `Metadata` and the `Hub[].Metadata` shapes.

### Queue hero + Verification detail sheet

- **"Now processing" hero on the Queue page.** A card above the table shows what's being worked on
  right now — file, GPU/CPU encoder, a live progress bar with fps/speed/ETA, and the live CPU/GPU
  usage graph — with a calm idle state ("nothing processing · N queued") when the worker is between
  jobs.
- **Verification page normalised to the shared detail sheet.** Clicking a result now opens the same
  slide-up `BottomSheet` (with the table shrinking to keep rows reachable) used by Inventory and
  Queue, instead of expanding a row in place — so the gate report and per-job details are consistent
  with the rest of the app.

### Queue: separate "Clear errored" and "Clear finished"

- The single "Clear finished" button is now two: **Clear errored** (failed + cancelled jobs) and
  **Clear finished** (completed jobs), each shown only when it has something to clear and labelled
  with its count. The `/api/jobs/clear` endpoint takes an optional `scope` (`errored` / `finished` /
  all) and keeps the existing safety check, so a job still holding a live rollback is never removed.

### Scheduling rework: separate scan / auto-optimise / auto-replace

The old model welded library scanning to the once-a-night auto-enqueue window and added a separate
*global* processing window on top, which was confusing. Global settings now control **one** thing —
how often libraries are scanned — and everything about *when work happens* lives per-library:

- **Library scan = global, on an interval.** A `LibraryScanWorker` rescans every enabled library
  every *N* hours (Settings → General → **Library scan interval**, default 1h, configurable) for file
  updates and re-probes. Scanning is idempotent and probing stays continuous, so the inventory is
  always current. This is the **only** scheduling setting in global settings.
- **The global processing window is removed.** Jobs you queue manually run whenever the queue can
  start one (concurrency limit + disk/activity gates); there is no global time gate anymore.
- **Per-library "Optimise automatically" + window = when files are enqueued *and* run.** Inside a
  library's window its eligible files are auto-enqueued **and** dispatched continuously; outside the
  window that library's jobs don't start (running jobs are never interrupted). Libraries without
  auto-optimise have no window — their manually-queued jobs run any time. The window inputs are shown
  only when the toggle is on.
- **New per-library "Replace automatically when verified" toggle.** When on, a job that passes every
  verification gate is replaced without the manual "Replace" click. The original is still quarantined
  first and is fully rollback-able (kept for the quarantine-retention period), so the safety model is
  unchanged; **default off**. A failed auto-replace (e.g. an unwritable folder) leaves the job
  ReadyToReplace for a manual retry. Round-trips through config export/import.
### Image-based subtitles into MP4: auto-MKV + clearer errors

- **Sources with image-based subtitles (Blu-ray PGS / DVD VobSub) now optimise instead of
  failing.** MP4 can only carry text subtitles (mov_text), so a remux with PGS used to fail with a
  cryptic "Subtitle encoding currently only possible from text to text…". When a video job targets
  MP4 and the source has bitmap subtitles, Optimisarr now muxes to **MKV** instead, preserving the
  subtitles via a stream copy. Detection is a quick probe gated to MP4-target jobs that actually
  have subtitle tracks; the container swap is in the pure, unit-tested `TranscodeSpecResolver`, and
  `SubtitleClassifier` (also tested) decides which codecs are image-based.
- **Clearer ffmpeg failure reasons generally.** A new pure, unit-tested `FfmpegErrorInterpreter`
  translates known ffmpeg errors into actionable messages (falling back to the raw output for
  anything unrecognised), so the Queue explains *why* a job failed and what to do.

### Per-library access check + graceful replace on permission errors

- **Replace no longer 500s on a permissions problem.** A media folder the container can't write
  to made the atomic-move probe throw `UnauthorizedAccessException` (not an `IOException`, so it
  escaped the catch) and surfaced as a raw 500. The probe now treats a permission-denied write as
  "not movable", and `ReplaceAsync` does an up-front writability check that fails with a clear,
  actionable message (and leaves the original untouched) instead of a 500.
- **New per-library "Test access" check.** `GET /api/libraries/{id}/access` reports whether the
  library path exists, is readable, and is writable; the Libraries page runs it on load and shows
  a badge (`access ok` / `not writable — replace will fail` / `can't read` / `path missing`) plus
  an inline fix hint, and a per-library **Test access** button re-runs it. This surfaces a
  misconfigured mount/permission *before* a replacement fails. Verdict/message logic is a pure,
  unit-tested `LibraryAccessEvaluator`.

### Settings: full-width, simpler tabs, clearer copy

- **Fills the page.** Every Settings tab now uses the full content width with responsive multi-column
  layouts (previously all but Tools were a narrow `max-w-2xl` column leaving most of the page empty).
- **Fewer, clearer tabs (6 → 5).** "Activity" and "Connections" merged into a single **Connections**
  tab with two sections — **Media servers** (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby) and **Download managers**
  (Sonarr/Radarr) — so all server connections live in one place. Pause-while-streaming is now a
  per-server "Pause while streaming" toggle rather than a separate tab/concept.
- **Verification gates** are presented as a tidy two-column grid of self-contained gate cards, each
  with plain-language help and a note that gates fail closed.
- Consistent section intros, toggle alignment, and headings throughout; the General "Save settings"
  button now notes that connections/notifications save on their own.
- **Rollover tooltips replace the wall of help text.** A new accessible `InfoTip` (hover/focus info
  icon) carries the per-setting explanations, and every `Toggle`'s hint now appears as a tooltip on
  an info icon next to its label rather than a sub-paragraph — so each row is a single dense line
  with its definition available on demand. Applied across Settings (and every toggle app-wide).

### Media-server connections: find Plex servers + test any connection

- **Test connection** for every media-server connection (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby): a button confirms the
  URL is reachable and the token is accepted, showing the server's name and version (or a clear
  reason it failed). When editing, a blank token tests the stored one. Plex tests `GET /`;
  Jellyfin/Emby test `GET /System/Info`.
- **Plex server discovery:** after signing in with Plex, Optimisarr lists the servers on the account
  (from `plex.tv/api/v2/resources`) and fills the connection in one click — preferring the **local**
  non-relay address and using that server's own access token. No more finding a host/port or token.
- Response parsing (Plex resources + connection preference, Plex/Jellyfin identity) is pure and
  unit-tested. Jellyfin/Emby keep manual URL entry + Test (LAN UDP discovery is unreliable from a
  bridge-networked container, so it is intentionally not used).

### Queue detail view, live CPU/GPU graph, and a sidebar activity indicator

- **Queue rows open a detail bottom sheet** (the same slide-up pattern as Inventory, now extracted
  into a shared `BottomSheet` component): a large progress bar, live fps/speed/ETA telemetry, the
  resolved encoder (GPU/CPU), output size, verification report, and the replace/retry/cancel
  actions in one place. The jobs table now scrolls internally with a sticky header and **shrinks
  when the sheet opens** (its height measured live) so rows stay reachable above the panel — like
  Inventory.
- **Live CPU/GPU usage graph** while a job is encoding, pushed over SignalR (`systemMetrics`). All
  sampling is **unprivileged** — `/proc/stat` for CPU and, for the GPU, the per-process DRM fdinfo
  of our own ffmpeg child, falling back to the AMD `gpu_busy_percent` sysfs node or an `nvidia-smi`
  query. No root, CAP_PERFMON, or container privilege is required; when no source applies the graph
  shows "GPU stats unavailable". The GPU path is vendor-neutral (Intel/AMD via DRM fdinfo, AMD via
  sysfs, NVIDIA via nvidia-smi) — nothing is hardcoded to one vendor.
- **Sidebar activity indicator:** the Queue nav item shows a throbbing **GPU chip** when work is
  hardware-accelerated, or a throbbing **snail** when it's grinding on the CPU, with a running-job
  count (a small pulsing dot when the rail is collapsed). Backed by one app-wide connection so it
  stays live on any page; queue status now reports whether the active work is hardware-accelerated.

### Hardware decoding (GPU decode) with automatic CPU fallback

- **The source is now decoded on the GPU when a hardware encoder is in use.** Previously a
  QSV/VAAPI job hardware-*encoded* but software-*decoded* the input, then uploaded frames to the
  GPU — so a large (e.g. 4K) source still pinned a CPU core or more just to decode. The ffmpeg
  command now adds `-hwaccel` with a matching `-hwaccel_output_format` before the input and drops
  the now-redundant `hwupload` filter, keeping frames on the GPU end to end.
- **New setting `queue.hardwareDecode` (Settings → Encoder mode), default on.** It only takes
  effect with a hardware encoder; CPU encoding is unaffected. An HDR→SDR tone-map job keeps
  software decode, because that filter runs in software and needs frames in system memory.
- **Automatic software-decode fallback.** Not every source codec/profile can be hardware-decoded;
  if a hardware-decode attempt fails at decoder/hwaccel setup, the job is retried once with the
  software-decode command instead of failing. The fallback is scoped to decode-setup failures, so
  an unrelated late failure (e.g. the disk filling mid-encode) is not retried needlessly.

### Schedule and Verification pages

- **Schedule page** (`/schedule`): a new dedicated page showing the current dispatch status
  (ready / paused + reason, running job count, work-disk free space), the configured processing
  window and whether the current time falls inside it (overnight windows handled correctly), and
  a per-library auto-enqueue table with the configured window and the last time each library ran.
  No settings are edited here; links point to Settings where changes are made.
- **Verification page** (`/verification`): a fleet-wide audit of every job that has passed
  through the Verifying step. Shows aggregate stats (total verified, pass rate, most-common
  failing check) and a filterable table (All / Passed / Failed). Each row expands to the full
  `VerificationChecks` gate report, reusing the same component as the Queue page. Both pages
  use only existing API endpoints — no backend changes required.
- Both routes are now **enabled** in the sidebar (previously "coming soon").

### Inventory bottom-sheet: gap fix, expand/collapse, and spinner direction

- **Closed the dead gap below the table.** The table container's `max-height` deduction was
  6 rem too large, leaving a constant gap between the table and the sheet (and the viewport
  bottom when the sheet was closed). Corrected to match the actual chrome above the table plus
  the main element's bottom padding.
- **Detail sheet can now collapse to a header strip.** A chevron control toggles between the
  full detail panel and a header-only strip. Collapsing shrinks the sheet, and the existing
  `ResizeObserver` automatically gives the table back the reclaimed height. Opening a new row
  always starts expanded.
- **Fixed the working spinner spinning the wrong way.** The `rotate` icon was a
  counter-clockwise arrow paired with the clockwise `animate-spin`, so it read as reversed.
  The icon path is now mirrored so the arrow follows the rotation direction.

### Inventory bottom-sheet: sidebar respect and table shrink

- **Sheet no longer overlays the sidebar.** The bottom sheet's left edge is now offset by the
  sidebar width (15 rem expanded / 4 rem collapsed) on desktop, with a smooth 200 ms transition
  that tracks sidebar collapse. On mobile, where the sidebar is an off-canvas overlay, the sheet
  stays full-width.
- **Table shrinks when the sheet opens.** The table container's `max-height` is dynamically
  reduced by the sheet's actual rendered height (measured via `ResizeObserver`), so all rows
  above the panel remain reachable by scrolling the table, not hidden behind the sheet.

### Inventory: viewport-filling table with bottom detail sheet

- **The table now fills the viewport and scrolls internally.** The page itself no longer scrolls;
  the table body scrolls within a fixed-height container so no rows are ever off-screen without
  being reachable by scrolling the table. The `thead` is sticky so column headers stay visible.
- **File details slide up from the bottom.** Clicking a row opens a fixed bottom sheet that slides
  in from below the viewport edge — no more scrolling past 50 rows to reach the detail card. The
  sheet persists while browsing; clicking a different row updates its content. Click the row again,
  press Escape, or click ✕ to dismiss.
- **Pagination moved above the table.** The page-counter and Previous/Next controls now live on the
  same bar as the filter tabs, always visible, so pagination never requires scrolling to the bottom.

### Fix: Intel QSV / VA-API hardware encoding not used despite GPU being present

- **Hardware encoding now actually reaches the GPU.** The entrypoint used `gosu user:group`,
  which drops all supplementary groups — including the `render` group that Docker's `group_add`
  adds for `/dev/dri` access. The ffmpeg hardware-capability probe (and the encode itself)
  therefore could not open `/dev/dri/renderD128`, the confirmation probe failed, and the encoder
  fell back to CPU `libx265`. The entrypoint now detects the GID(s) of every device under
  `/dev/dri`, adds them to the app user before switching context, and calls `gosu` with just the
  username so supplementary groups are preserved.

### Preview playback fallback

- **Side-by-side previews now offer direct downloads of both exact streams.** Browser playback
  remains native—Optimisarr never creates a second, browser-friendly re-encode that could distort
  the quality comparison. When a browser cannot decode the source container, video, or audio codec,
  the operator can download either the original or real encoded preview for local inspection.

### Security

- **Updated the native SQLite library to 3.50.3.** EF Core 10.0.8 otherwise transitively selected
  `SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3` 2.1.11, which carries the high-severity SQLite CVE-2025-6965 advisory.

### Inventory is now bounded and inspectable

- **The Inventory no longer renders one unbounded file table.** It now displays 50 files at a
  time with explicit Previous/Next controls and a clear filtered/total count. The table is limited
  to scan-oriented fields; selecting a row opens a detail card beneath it with stream data, rule
  verdict, probe error, and the Probe/Re-probe and Preview actions.

### Fix: MP4 previews with SubRip subtitles

- **MP4/MOV video output now transcodes text subtitles to `mov_text`.** Preview jobs mapped every
  source stream and copied subtitle streams unchanged. A common Matroska SubRip subtitle therefore
  made the MP4 muxer reject the output before any video frame was encoded. Matroska outputs continue
  to preserve subtitle codecs by stream copy; MP4/MOV uses its native text-subtitle codec.

### Previews are fast now (no more sitting on "Verifying")

- **Video previews encode a short sample, not the whole file.** A preview used to run a full
  transcode *and* the full verification (decode-health + VMAF over the entire file), so a long video
  sat on "Verifying" for ages. A video preview now encodes a **60-second sample taken from the middle
  of the file** (representative content, not the intro). This originally skipped gating verification
  for speed; the current preview path now verifies against a temporary clipped reference from the same
  middle segment. Audio/image previews already finished quickly and run in full. The size saving for
  a sampled video is shown bitrate-based (`≈`) with a note that it is a sample; a full optimise still
  encodes and verifies the whole file.

### Settings preview — compare original vs encoded before committing (Phase 11)

- **Try a library's settings on a real file and see the result.** A **Preview** action on each
  eligible candidate (Inventory and the Libraries workspace) runs a throwaway transcode of that one
  file with the library's resolved settings, then shows the **original next to the encoded result**:
  a per-media-type viewer (image ↔ image, video ↔ video, audio ↔ audio, streamed with range support
  so you can seek), a size/codec/container/resolution/audio stats table with the **% size saving**,
  and the full verification report (VMAF/SSIM and the other gates).
- **Safe by construction.** A preview is a dedicated job type that runs the real
  probe→transcode→verify pipeline but **never moves or replaces** anything, writes to its own
  `/work/preview/<id>` scratch area, is hidden from the queue, is deleted when you close the panel,
  and never survives a restart (purged on startup). The original is guaranteed untouched.
- **The same visual compare now lives in Quarantine too.** The compare-to-approve panel adds the
  side-by-side viewers (the quarantined original vs the in-place replacement, both streamed from
  disk) alongside the existing size/saving and verification report — so you can see/hear the
  difference before approving or rolling back, not just read the numbers. The shared viewer
  (`MediaCompare`) is used by both the preview and the quarantine panels.
- Deferred for now: in-browser playback of some encoded codecs (HEVC/AV1) depends on the browser;
  the stats and verification still apply. Clip-mode has since shipped: sampled video previews verify
  against the same middle segment of the original and label scores as segment-only.

### The Queue shows which encoder each job used (GPU vs CPU)

- **Hardware-vs-software encoding is now visible at a glance.** Each video job records its resolved
  encoder (e.g. `hevc_nvenc`, `hevc_qsv`, `libx265`) and the Queue shows a **GPU**/**CPU** badge with
  the encoder name under the file. No more reading the ffmpeg command line to tell whether a transcode
  ran on the GPU — useful when bringing up a new GPU (e.g. an Intel N100). New nullable `Job.VideoEncoder`
  column (additive migration) surfaced through `/api/jobs`.

### Hardware encoders are confirmed by a real test encode

- **Encoder availability is now proven, not inferred.** Detection previously reported a hardware
  encoder available whenever ffmpeg listed it and a device node existed (`/dev/dri` for QSV/VAAPI,
  a working `nvidia-smi` for NVENC). That cheap check still runs as a pre-filter, but any hardware
  encoder that clears it is then **confirmed with a tiny throwaway encode** (a few 320x240 frames to
  the null muxer, using the same device-init/upload arguments a real transcode would). A
  present-but-broken driver, or a codec the GPU does not actually support (e.g. `av1_qsv` on older
  Intel), is now reported unavailable instead of being assumed to work — and selection won't pick an
  encoder that would fail at job start. CPU encoders are trusted from the listing.
- **Detection is cached** (hardware doesn't change while the process runs), so the per-job encoder
  resolution no longer re-spawns ffmpeg every time. The Tools page **Refresh** button forces a fresh
  probe (`GET /api/system/hardware?refresh=true`) for when a GPU is added or a driver is fixed.

### Fix: GPU encoding silently fell back to CPU

- **A video re-encode now always uses the selected hardware encoder.** The worker resolved a
  GPU/CPU encoder only when a file's detected `MediaKind` was exactly `Video`, but the FFmpeg
  command builder treats anything that isn't audio/image as a video re-encode. A video file
  classified `Unknown` (e.g. a row probed before media-kind detection existed) therefore skipped
  encoder selection and silently transcoded on the CPU library encoder even when NVENC/QSV/VAAPI
  was available and selected. Encoder resolution is now gated on the transcode spec actually
  re-encoding video (a non-null target video codec), so the worker and the command builder always
  agree. The chosen encoder is logged per job so CPU-vs-GPU is visible.
- **Correct per-encoder rate control and hardware device setup.** The command builder previously
  emitted `-crf` and an x264-style `-preset` for *every* video re-encode, which NVENC ignores
  (so it ran at default quality, not the configured CRF) and which QSV/VAAPI reject outright. The
  builder now branches on the resolved encoder: software x264/x265/SVT-AV1 keep `-crf`; **NVENC**
  uses constant-quality `-cq` (VBR, no bitrate cap); **QSV** uses `-global_quality` with
  `-init_hw_device qsv=hw`; **VAAPI** uses `-rc_mode CQP -qp` with `-vaapi_device` declared before
  the input and a `format=nv12,hwupload` step appended after any tone-map. (NVENC is validated on
  an RTX 4070; QSV/VAAPI argument shape is unit-tested and pending on-hardware validation — see
  KNOWN_ISSUES.)
- **Intel iGPU (N100) and AMD GPU transcoding via jellyfin-ffmpeg.** Transcoding and hardware
  detection now run through jellyfin-ffmpeg (already bundled for VMAF), which ships the Intel iHD
  driver + oneVPL (libvpl) runtime and NVENC support — so one binary covers NVIDIA, Intel QSV/VA-API,
  and AMD VA-API without chasing distro driver packages. The transcode/detection binary is
  configurable via the new `OPTIMISARR_FFMPEG` env (defaults to jellyfin-ffmpeg in the image,
  `ffmpeg` on PATH otherwise); detection and transcode share it so the reported encoder list always
  matches what runs. The compose example now documents mapping `/dev/dri` **and** adding the
  container user to the host `render` group (required to open the device) for Intel/AMD, alongside
  the existing NVIDIA reservation. The NVIDIA block now also documents the required
  `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,video,utility` — without the `video` capability the NVENC
  library is not injected and hardware encoding fails with "Cannot load libnvidia-encode.so.1"
  even though `nvidia-smi` works (the plain `--gpus all` default grants only `compute,utility`).
  NVENC was validated end-to-end on an RTX 4070 with this configuration (encoder utilisation
  52–81% during a real transcode).
- **Re-classify legacy `Unknown` media.** Files probed before media-kind detection existed were left
  as `Unknown` and the idempotent scan never revisited them, so an actual video/audio/image stayed
  misclassified (and an audio/image file would have been sent down the video pipeline). A one-time
  startup backfill resets such already-probed `Unknown` files to `Discovered` so the normal probe
  worker re-probes and re-classifies them; it is guarded by a settings flag so it runs exactly once.

### Inventory and Candidates merged into one page

- **One media view instead of two.** The Inventory page now shows each file's stream detail *and*
  its eligibility — an **Optimise?** column (Eligible / Skipped / Not probed) with the reason — so
  "what do I have?" and "will it be optimised, and why?" are answered in one place rather than across
  two screens. An eligibility filter (All / Eligible / Skipped / Not probed) sits alongside the
  library filter, and the Probe/Re-probe action is unchanged (a freshly probed file gets its verdict
  immediately).
- The standalone **Candidates page and its sidebar entry are removed**; the old `#/candidates` route
  now lands on Inventory. (The Libraries workspace keeps its per-library Candidates tab.) Reuses the
  existing `/api/media` and `/api/candidates` endpoints — no API or eligibility-logic changes.

### Preset slider says exactly what every position selects

- **The per-library video preset slider is no longer a black box.** Each position now shows the
  codec it resolves to (Compatibility → H.264, Balanced → HEVC, Efficiency → AV1), with the active
  position's full codec/container/CRF still spelled out in the "Selects: …" row.
- **Accurate by construction.** Those specs are now served from the backend's `RuleProfileDefaults`
  via `/api/library-options` (new `ruleProfileSpecs`) instead of a hard-coded UI table, so the
  slider can never drift from what the server actually does when an option changes.

### Quarantine compare-to-approve

- **Review a replacement before deciding.** Each replacement on the Quarantine page now expands into
  a compare panel showing the quarantined original vs the in-place replacement — size and saving %,
  plus the full verification report (the measured VMAF/SSIM, duration, audio-retention and other
  gates, the same ✓/✗ list the Queue shows) — so the decision isn't made on a size number alone.
- **Approve or reject from one screen.** **Approve & free space** deletes the quarantined original
  now (reclaiming space immediately instead of waiting for the retention window; the replacement is
  kept and can no longer be rolled back), and **Reject (roll back)** restores the original. Both
  reuse the existing purge and rollback services — no new destructive path, safety model unchanged.
- New `GET /api/replacements/{id}` (replacement + its job's verification report) and
  `POST /api/replacements/{id}/approve` (on-demand single purge). The report renders through a shared
  `VerificationChecks` component now used by both the Queue and Quarantine pages. Visual media
  preview (players/thumbnails) is deferred.

### Unified Library & Candidates workspace (Phase 12)

- **Tune a library's rules and see what they select in one place.** Opening a library is now a
  tabbed workspace: a **Rules** tab (the existing preset + Advanced form) and a **Candidates** tab
  listing the eligible/skipped decisions for *that* library, with the same reasons the Candidates
  page shows. No more hopping to a separate screen and re-selecting the library to see a change's
  effect.
- **Re-resolve on Save.** The Candidates tab reflects the library's *saved* rules; after you Save
  (and after Scan/Enqueue) it re-fetches, and the workspace stays open so the change → effect loop
  is immediate. The tab shows the live eligible count.
- **Eligible/skipped tallies on the Libraries list.** Each library card now shows its candidate
  tally, backed by a lightweight `GET /api/candidates/summary` that reuses the pure
  `CandidateEvaluator` (counts only — the list never fetches every probed file row).
- The standalone all-libraries **Candidates page is kept** for the cross-library view; both it and
  the new tab share one `CandidateTable` component. **No domain logic changed** and the safety
  model is unchanged — enqueue still only queues; nothing here replaces or deletes.

### Opt-in image EXIF/ICC-retention verification gate

- **New verification gate for photo/image jobs.** When enabled (Settings → Verification → "Preserve
  image EXIF/ICC metadata"), an image whose re-encode silently **drops the original's embedded ICC
  colour profile or EXIF metadata** fails verification, so the original is never replaced by a copy
  that lost its colour profile or capture data. Some encoders/containers discard these by default,
  which can shift colours, so a colour-sensitive library can now demand they survive. The gate only
  flags **loss** — an output may *gain* metadata (Optimisarr stamps its own `Software` marker)
  without failing — and **fails closed**: if the metadata can't be read it blocks rather than
  assumes retention. Off by default. Metadata is read with `exiftool` (pure, unit-tested
  `ImageMetadataParser`; `ImageMetadataService` runs the process), since ffprobe does not surface
  ICC/EXIF reliably across the still formats. Wired through the verification policy, settings
  persistence, and the API like the existing SSIM gate.

### Output filename collision fixed (work path + replacement)

Two source files that differ only by extension (e.g. `photo.bmp` and `photo.tif`, both targeting
`photo.webp`) used to resolve to the **same** output path, so the second job could clobber the
first's output. Closed on both layers, with no change to the safety model (originals were already
recoverable; this prevents wasted/incorrect work):

- **Unique work output per source.** Each file's transcode now lands under a per-media-file work
  root (`/work/<mediaFileId>/…`), so two sources sharing a stem can never write to the same work
  path and overwrite each other's verified output before it is moved or replaced. Pure, unit-tested
  `WorkOutputRoot`; the move-to-target destination still mirrors the library's natural structure
  (the id segment never leaks into the target folder).
- **Safe-fail on replacement collision.** If a verified output's final destination is already
  occupied by a *different* file (another source that optimised to the same name), the replacement
  now **fails with a clear "would collide with an existing file" reason and leaves the original
  untouched** — instead of quarantining and then erroring on the move. An unchanged-container
  replacement landing back on the original's own path is still the normal case, not a collision.
- **Work scratch directories are pruned.** Because each job's output now lives under
  `/work/<mediaFileId>/…`, a finished job (deleted, moved to a target folder, or replaced) now
  removes the empty per-media scratch directory it leaves behind, so `/work` no longer accumulates
  one empty tree per file ever processed. Pruning only ever deletes *empty* directories and never
  the work root, so it cannot touch real output (pure, unit-tested `WorkPaths.PruneEmptyAncestors`).

### Per-library move-overwrite control + explicit preset sliders

- **Overwrite tickbox for "move output to a target folder".** When a library moves its completed
  output into a target folder, a new per-library **Overwrite an existing converted file** option
  controls what happens if a converted file is already there: on → replace it; **off (default) →
  the job fails with a clear reason** and leaves the new output in the work directory, rather than
  silently clobbering the existing file. Originals are never affected either way. Schema column
  `Library.MoveOverwrite` via migration `AddLibraryMoveOverwrite`, wired through the request
  parser, DTO, and config import/export. (The trash/quarantine directory is configurable via
  `OPTIMISARR_TRASH_DIR`, and quarantine retention via Settings → General → Replacement.)
- **Sliders now say exactly what they select.** The per-library video and image preset sliders show
  a "Selects: …" badge row with the concrete codec/container/CRF (video) or format/quality (image)
  the current position resolves to — accounting for any Advanced overrides — so the slider is no
  longer a black box. (Richer slider options are tracked on the roadmap.)

### Image optimisation: JPEG/WebP/AVIF, downscaling, and a portable marker

A big expansion of the image pipeline so it fits real media stacks rather than assuming WebP
everywhere.

- **Three output formats on a compatibility→efficiency slider.** WebP-only was the wrong default —
  **Plex does not display WebP photos**, and AVIF support is newer-clients-only. Photo libraries now
  get their own one-choice slider (the image counterpart of the video preset): **JPEG** (max
  compatibility — every server/client incl. Plex), **WebP** (smaller; Jellyfin/modern), **AVIF**
  (smallest; newer clients only). All three are genuinely wired in the command builder — JPEG via
  `mjpeg -q:v`, AVIF via `libaom-av1` constant-quality CRF — with a single
  0–100 quality mapped onto each encoder's native scale. JXL is detected as a *source* but is no
  longer an encode target (no media server displays it).
- **New default for Photo libraries is JPEG**, not WebP — safety/compatibility beats savings, and a
  fresh photo library now displays on every server out of the box. (Existing libraries keep whatever
  they had.)
- **Downscaling.** A per-library option fits images within a named cap (**4K** / **1080p**), a
  **custom max long-edge**, or a **percentage** of the original — always keeping aspect ratio and
  **never upscaling** (pure `ImageScale` filter builder, unit tested). The verification "Dimensions"
  gate is now downscale-aware: an operator-requested downscale passes (judged for no-enlarge and a
  preserved aspect ratio), while an *unrequested* shrink still fails as a corrupt encode — mirroring
  how an intentional audio downmix is handled.
- **Portable optimisation marker for every image format (resolves `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` #1).** ffmpeg's
  still encoders silently drop `-metadata`, so an image's "already optimised" fingerprint is now
  written and read with **exiftool** in the standard EXIF/XMP `Software` field
  (`optimisarr/<version>`) — a new `exiftool` dependency added to the image. The marker now travels
  *with the file* for JPEG/WebP/AVIF, surviving a database wipe or a move to another machine, exactly
  like the container marker on video/audio. Writing is best-effort: if exiftool is unavailable,
  re-optimisation is still prevented by the database history and the "already in the target format"
  check.
- Schema: two new `Library` columns (`ImageDownscaleMode`, `ImageDownscaleValue`) via migration
  `AddLibraryImageDownscale`; wired through the request parser/validation, library DTO, rule
  resolver, and config import/export.

### Image quality (SSIM) verification gate

- **Opt-in image structural-quality gate.** Image jobs can now be held to a perceptual
  bar, the still-image counterpart of the VMAF gate for video. When enabled, the output
  still is scored against the original with FFmpeg's `ssim` filter (the distorted picture
  `scale2ref`-scaled to the reference so dimensions match), and replacement is blocked when
  the all-channel SSIM falls below a configurable floor (conservative default 0.95). Like the
  other quality gates it **fails closed**: if SSIM can't be measured, the job fails rather than
  replacing on unproven quality. All gate logic is pure and unit tested
  (`ImageSsimParser`, `VerificationEvaluator`), with the measurement isolated in
  `ImageQualityService` (no live FFmpeg in tests). Off by default; configured from Settings →
  Verification, persisted via two new settings keys and round-tripped by config import/export.
  This satisfies the Phase 10 exit criterion that image verification can block replacement on
  quality loss. (EXIF/ICC-profile retention remains deferred — it is coupled to the
  exiftool metadata-writing work tracked in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` #1, since `libwebp` drops
  metadata today.)

### Image optimisation: skip animated images; Candidates profile column; KNOWN_ISSUES

- **Animated images are left untouched.** An animated GIF (or animated WebP) is really a short
  video; treating it as a still flattened it into a broken, larger single-frame output (which
  verification correctly failed, leaving the original safe — but wastefully). The probe now records
  the picture stream's **frame count** (`MediaFile.FrameCount`, migration `AddMediaFileFrameCount`),
  and a multi-frame image is skipped as a candidate with a clear "Animated image (N frames)" reason.
- **Candidates page no longer shows a video profile for audio/image rows.** The "Profile" column
  (a video preset) now shows "—" for audio and image files, which are governed by their own
  audio/image rules — matching the same fix already applied to the Libraries page.
- Added **`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`** documenting the open items found during live testing: the WebP marker
  not round-tripping (ffmpeg limitation; re-optimisation still prevented by the DB history), and the
  output-filename collision when two sources share a stem (originals never lost; only an optimised
  output can be overwritten in move-on-complete mode).

### Fix: discovered files are now probed automatically (queue was empty after a scan)

- Scanning only records that a file *exists*; candidate evaluation needs its codec, media kind, and
  dimensions, which come from a probe — but **nothing probed discovered files automatically**.
  Probing was a manual, per-file button on the Inventory page, so a freshly scanned library sat at
  "Discovered", produced **zero candidates, and could never be enqueued** (for any media type —
  it surfaced first on new Music/Photo libraries).
- Added a **background prober** (`MediaProbeWorker`) that probes discovered files in batches
  shortly after a scan, so a library becomes a set of candidates without hand-probing each file.
  Probe failures are recorded as `ProbeFailed` and not retried, so the sweep converges.
- **Auto-enqueue** now probes a library's newly discovered files between scanning and enqueuing,
  so files found in a run can actually be queued in that same run (previously its scan-then-enqueue
  enqueued nothing because the just-discovered files had no probe data yet). Shared via a new
  `LibraryInventoryService.ProbePendingAsync`.

### Fix: media-type handling — non-video libraries now work properly

A sweep of places that assumed every library is video:

- **Scans now discover the right files for the library's type.** The scanner only knew video
  extensions, so a **Music or Photo library discovered nothing** (and a re-scan of an "Other"
  library missed its audio/images). `LibraryScanner` now has separate video/audio/image extension
  sets and an `ExtensionsFor(MediaType)` helper; the inventory scan picks the set matching the
  library — audio for Music, images for Photo, video for Film/TV, all three for Other — so a Film
  library still ignores stray poster images while a Music/Photo library finds its content. The
  image set is shared with the kind classifier so discovery and classification can't drift.
- **New `Photo` media type.** Still-image libraries no longer have to masquerade as "Other": a
  `Photo` type discovers images and exposes the image rules. The Advanced sections are now scoped
  via `isVideoType`/`isAudioType`/`isImageType` (images show for Photo *and* Other; the Audio
  channels control is hidden for a Photo library, which has no audio).
- **The rule-profile badge no longer shows on non-video libraries.** A Music or Photo library was
  labelled e.g. "ConservativeHevc" — a meaningless video preset. The profile badge on the library
  card, the preset slider, and the preset summary are all video-only now; Music and Photo show a
  type-appropriate note (audio → Opus, images → WebP) instead of a video preset.
- **Candidates page is kind-aware.** Its "Video" column (which only ever showed the video codec)
  is now a **Codec** column showing the codec that matters for each file — audio codec for music,
  image codec for stills — and audio/image rows carry a small **Kind** badge. The candidate API
  gained `mediaKind` and a unified `codec` field to back this.

### Library form: surface preset overrides, and unsaved-changes tracking

- **Preset override visibility.** When a library sets its **Target codec** or **Container**
  manually in Advanced, the compatibility↔efficiency preset slider can imply a codec that isn't
  actually used. The slider now stays editable (it still sets the baseline the non-overridden
  values follow) but shows an **"Overridden"** badge and a short note saying which setting was
  taken over (e.g. "codec (AV1) and container (.mkv)"), with a **"Reset to preset"** action that
  clears those two overrides. Chosen over disabling the slider so the operator is never trapped
  and the state is honest. Only the codec/container overrides trigger this — unrelated Advanced
  settings (audio, eligibility, etc.) don't.
- **Unsaved-changes (dirty) tracking.** The library editor now tracks whether the form differs
  from when it was opened: **Save** is disabled until something actually changes; an **"Unsaved
  changes"** indicator appears next to it; and discarding edits is guarded — cancelling, opening a
  different library, or starting a new one while there are unsaved changes prompts for
  confirmation, as does a full page reload/close.
- **Navigation guard.** Leaving the page entirely with unsaved edits — clicking another sidebar
  item or using the browser back/forward — now prompts the same confirmation instead of silently
  discarding the changes. Implemented as a single leave-guard in the hash router that any page can
  register while it has unsaved work (the library editor is the first to use it); a declined prompt
  cancels the navigation and keeps you on the page.

### Image optimisation: per-library overrides (Phase 10)

- A library can now **override the image rules**, the same way it overrides audio/video: a **target
  format**, an **image quality** (1–100), and a **"re-encode lossy images too"** toggle (which makes
  already-compressed sources like JPEG eligible, not just lossless PNG/BMP/TIFF/GIF). Stored as three
  new nullable `Library` columns via migration `AddLibraryImageOverrides`; `null` means "use the
  default" (WebP, quality 80, lossless-only). Wired end to end: `RuleOverrides`/`RuleResolver`, the
  library request parser (with validation), the library DTO and `library-options`, and the
  secret-free config export/import snapshot.
- The override controls appear in a new **Images** section of a library's Advanced options, scoped to
  mixed **Other** libraries (where still images live — there is no dedicated photo type). The
  **format picker only offers WebP** for now: `ImageTarget.EncodableFormats` gates the choice to
  formats whose encode is actually wired, so an operator can't select AVIF/JXL and have the job fail
  later — they appear automatically once their encode lands.

### Fix: scope the optimisation-preset slider to the library's media type

- The top-of-form **compatibility↔efficiency preset slider** is a *video* decision (it picks
  H.264/HEVC/AV1), but it was shown for every media type — so switching a library to **Music**
  left the video slider and its video-centric summary in place, unchanged. It is now scoped like
  the Advanced sections: Film/TV and Other show the slider (and remux toggle + preset summary),
  while a Music library shows a short audio-appropriate note instead (lossless → Opus 128 kbps by
  default; codec/bitrate in Advanced). No behaviour change to saved values — purely which control
  is presented.

### Image optimisation: kind-aware verification gates (Phase 10)

- Verification is now **image-aware**, so an image job can pass through to replacement instead
  of falsely failing. Previously every non-audio job was treated as video, so a still — which has
  no duration — would fail the duration gate outright. An image is now judged as a still: it must
  **decode cleanly**, be **readable**, contain a **picture stream**, **keep its dimensions** (no
  downscaling is performed yet, so any shrink is a degenerate/corrupt encode and fails), and be
  **smaller** than the original. The time-based and stream gates that don't apply to a still
  (duration, audio/subtitle retention, A/V sync, timestamps, tail, HDR, VMAF, loudness/clipping)
  are skipped rather than evaluated.
- `VerificationInput` gains original/output width+height (populated from the existing output and
  original probes), feeding the new **Dimensions** gate. All new gate logic is pure and unit
  tested. Per-kind quality scoring (SSIM) and EXIF/ICC-retention gates for images are still to
  come.

### Image optimisation: transcode command building + marker (Phase 10)

- The image pipeline now **produces an output**, not just a candidate decision. `TranscodeSpec`
  carries an image encoder + quality, `TranscodeSpecResolver` resolves an image job to a
  `libwebp` encode with the target extension (e.g. `Photo.png` → `/work/.../Photo.webp`), and
  `FfmpegCommandBuilder` emits the encode: `-map_metadata 0` (so the source **EXIF/ICC profile
  is preserved** — a Phase 10 verification deliverable), the primary picture stream mapped, the
  encoder, and `-quality <n>`.
- **Optimisation marker on image outputs.** Like video/audio, an image output is stamped with the
  `optimisarr` marker so a re-optimised image is recognised and skipped — closing the
  re-optimisation loop the candidate rules opened. (The marker is written into the output
  metadata; its persistence across the WebP container is verified against the bundled ffmpeg
  in-container, with the candidate "already in target format" check as the active guard in the
  meantime.)
- The queue dispatcher no longer resolves a video hardware/software encoder for image jobs (only
  video re-encodes need one); the image encode uses the encoder from the spec.
- **WebP is the only reachable target today** (per-library image overrides aren't wired yet, so
  the resolved format is always the WebP default). AVIF (`libaom-av1`) and JXL (`libjxl`) are
  selectable in `ImageTarget` but their quality mapping is not wired: the builder **throws a clear
  `NotSupportedException`** rather than emit a wrongly-scaled encode, until those parameters are
  validated against the bundled encoders. Image verification gates and per-library overrides/UI
  follow in later slices.

### Image optimisation: candidate rules (Phase 10)

- First slice of **image optimisation**: an image file is no longer skipped as "not available
  yet" — `CandidateEvaluator` now decides image eligibility like it does audio. A new pure,
  unit-tested `ImageTarget` defines the supported modern target formats (**WebP** — the
  compatible default — **AVIF**, and **JXL**), the conservative defaults (WebP, quality 80, a
  200 KB minimum size), and which source formats are worth re-encoding.
- **Lossless sources (PNG/BMP/TIFF/GIF) are eligible** to re-encode to the target format — a
  large saving with no quality loss. An **already-lossy image (e.g. a JPEG) is left untouched by
  default**; a per-library **"re-encode lossy images"** opt-in makes it eligible too. A still
  already in the target format is skipped (mapping ffprobe's codec names — an `.avif` probes as
  `av1`, a `.jxl` as `jpegxl` — back to the chosen format), as is anything below the minimum
  size. New `RuleSettings` fields `TargetImageFormat`, `ImageQuality`, and `ReencodeLossyImages`
  carry the rules; per-library overrides, command building, and verification follow in later
  slices.

### UI polish: mobile layout and a tidier library settings form

- **Mobile layout.** On small screens the sidebar is now an off-canvas drawer (opened from a
  hamburger in a new mobile top bar, dismissed by tapping the backdrop) and returns to the
  static, collapsible rail at `md+`. Fixed the **horizontal overflow** where page content ran
  off-screen to the right on phones — the main content column was sizing to its widest child;
  it now has `min-w-0` so wide tables/grids stay within the viewport (and scroll within their
  own card). Library card actions wrap instead of overflowing, and page padding tightens on
  mobile. On the **Settings** page the tab bar now scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping,
  and the activity/notification/connection list rows wrap their badges and actions onto a
  second line rather than overflowing. The **Inventory, Candidates, Queue, and Quarantine**
  tables now hide secondary columns on small screens (revealing them progressively at `sm`/`md`/
  `lg`) so the essential columns and actions fit a phone without horizontal scrolling.
- Fixed two follow-ups from the above: the mobile sidebar drawer now always shows nav **labels**
  (the collapse-to-icons state is desktop-only, so a previously-collapsed session no longer left
  the full-width drawer icon-only), and the library **Advanced options** panel always opens
  collapsed instead of auto-expanding for libraries that had non-default settings.
- **Library settings form.** The expanded per-library settings are reorganised into clearly
  titled sections — **Video**, **Audio**, **Audio channels**, **Eligibility & queue**,
  **Completed output** — each with a one-line description and separated by dividers, instead of
  one long interleaved list. Sections are **scoped to the library's media type** (Video only for
  Film/TV, Audio only for Music, both for Other), so an operator only sees the controls that
  apply. All settings remain behind the collapsed **Advanced options** panel; the simple choice
  (name, path, type, and the compatibility↔efficiency preset) stays up front.

### Optimisation preset is a simple compatibility↔efficiency slider (Phase 10)

- The per-library encode preset is now a single **compatibility → efficiency slider**
  (Compatibility / Balanced / Efficiency → H.264 / HEVC / AV1) instead of a codec-named
  dropdown, so the common case is one self-explanatory choice. A separate **"Just clean up
  containers — no re-encode"** toggle above the slider selects the Remux/Cleanup profile (which
  isn't on the quality axis) and disables the slider while it's on. The live preset description
  still explains the chosen tradeoff. Purely presentation over the existing `ruleProfile` value
  — no API change — and every exact knob (codec, container, CRF, audio codec/bitrate, downmix,
  HDR, resolution cap) stays under **Advanced options**.

### Researched, sane default profiles per container/use-case (Phase 10)

- Each rule profile now ships an **opinionated, matched container + quality default** instead of
  leaving every knob to the operator, based on current (2026) device/codec compatibility and
  visually-transparent quality research:
  - **Conservative HEVC** → **MP4** container (HEVC + AAC plays on virtually all phones, smart
    TVs, and Apple devices), default **CRF 24** (visually transparent at 1080p).
  - **Compatibility H.264** → **MP4** container (H.264 + AAC plays everywhere), default **CRF 20**.
  - **Experimental AV1** → **MKV** container (AV1 + Opus for maximum efficiency; MP4 + Opus has
    poor player support), default **CRF 30**.
  - **Remux/Cleanup** → MKV, unchanged (no re-encode, no CRF).
- **Default CRF** is new: previously a re-encode with no per-library quality override fell back
  to the encoder's arbitrary built-in default (e.g. libx265's 28). Each re-encode profile now
  has a researched, visually-transparent `DefaultCrf`; a per-library `QualityCrf` override still
  takes precedence (`RuleSettings.DefaultCrf`, applied in the queue dispatcher).
- **Audio still defaults to copy** on every profile — a video re-encode never silently downgrades
  the original audio (including lossless surround). The profile descriptions document the
  recommended audio codec (AAC for the compatibility profiles, Opus for AV1) to opt into in
  Advanced options.
- **Behaviour change for libraries using profile defaults:** the HEVC and H.264 profiles now
  remux into **MP4** rather than MKV, and re-encodes target the researched CRF. Libraries with an
  explicit container or `QualityCrf` override are unaffected. Pure `RuleProfileDefaults` /
  `RuleResolver` / `TranscodeSpecResolver` changes are unit tested.

### Re-encode lossy audio when it genuinely saves space (Phase 10)

- Audio optimisation previously only considered **lossless** sources (FLAC, ALAC, PCM, …),
  leaving already-lossy files untouched to avoid generational quality loss. Each library can
  now opt in to **re-encoding lossy audio too** (e.g. a 320 kbps MP3 → 128 kbps Opus) via a new
  "Re-encode lossy audio too" toggle in the audio Advanced options. It defaults to **off**, so
  the conservative lossless-only behaviour is unchanged unless the operator opts in.
- The opt-in only makes a lossy file eligible when re-encoding it would **genuinely save
  space**: the source bitrate must exceed the target by at least 25%
  (`AudioTarget.LossyReencodeSaves`). A file already at/near the target, or one whose source
  bitrate ffprobe could not report, is left untouched with a clear reason — so the queue never
  churns a file for a marginal saving or a likely size *increase*. Re-encoding a file already
  in the target codec is still skipped as before.
- Probing now records the **source audio bitrate** (the highest audio stream's `bit_rate`, or
  the container bitrate for an audio-only file; never the container bitrate of a video file,
  which is dominated by video). New nullable `MediaFile.AudioBitrateKbps` and non-nullable
  `Library.ReencodeLossyAudio` columns (one additive migration, defaulting existing rows to
  null/false; re-running it is a no-op), carried in config export/import and surfaced as a Kind-
  appropriate toggle. The pure `CandidateEvaluator`, `RuleResolver`, `AudioTarget`, and
  `MediaProbeService.Parse` changes are unit tested.

### Library Advanced options are scoped to the media type (Phase 10)

- The library Advanced-options form now shows **only the controls that apply to the library's
  media type**: video knobs (target video codec/container, HDR handling, encoder preset, CRF,
  resolution limit, the video-audio codec/bitrate, and the VMAF quality gate) for **Film/TV**
  libraries, and the audio target codec/bitrate for **Music** libraries. A mixed **Other**
  library still shows everything, since it may hold more than one kind. The stereo-downmix
  toggle stays visible for every type because it applies wherever audio is re-encoded.
- This removes the previous clutter where, e.g., a Music library showed video codec, CRF,
  preset, resolution, HDR, and VMAF (all irrelevant to audio) and a Film/TV library showed the
  audio-only "Audio target codec". Purely a UI refinement — the underlying per-library
  overrides are unchanged and any previously stored values are preserved.

### Stereo downmix (Phase 10)

- Each library can now **downmix multichannel audio to 2.0 stereo** on re-encode, in Advanced
  options. It applies to audio-only jobs and to the re-encoded audio of a video transcode
  (only where the audio is actually re-encoded — a copied track keeps its layout), emitting
  `-ac 2`. Defaults to **off**, so surround is preserved unless the operator opts in. New
  non-nullable `Library.DownmixToStereo` column (additive migration defaulting existing rows
  to false; re-running it is a no-op), carried in config export/import.
- The verification audio-fidelity gate understands the **intentional reduction**: a requested
  downmix (e.g. 5.1 → 2.0) passes instead of being flagged as a silent channel loss, while an
  *unrequested* downmix still fails and a downmix that dropped audio entirely still fails. The
  pure `FfmpegCommandBuilder`, `TranscodeSpecResolver`, `RuleResolver`, and
  `VerificationEvaluator` changes are unit tested.

### Audio codec selection for video transcodes (Phase 10)

- A video re-encode previously always copied its audio (`-c:a copy`). Each library can now
  opt to **transcode the audio of a video** to a chosen codec and bitrate in Advanced options
  — **AAC** (the broadly compatible default), **Opus**, or **MP3** — reusing the same encoder
  mapping as audio-only jobs. The control defaults to **Copy (leave audio untouched)**, so
  nothing changes unless the operator opts in. Works whether the video is re-encoded or just
  remuxed; subtitles and video are still preserved. New nullable `Library.VideoAudioCodec`/
  `VideoAudioBitrateKbps` columns (additive migration; re-running it is a no-op), validated on
  save and carried in config export/import.
- Verification understands the intentional re-encode: a video job that transcoded its audio
  may **normalise the sample rate** (e.g. to 48 kHz) without tripping the audio-fidelity gate,
  exactly like an audio-only job. A copied audio track (the default) still must keep its
  original sample rate, and a silent channel downmix still fails for both. The pure
  `FfmpegCommandBuilder`, `TranscodeSpecResolver`, `RuleResolver`, and `VerificationEvaluator`
  changes are all unit tested.

### Per-library audio rules

- Each library can now **override the audio target codec (Opus, AAC, or MP3) and bitrate**
  in Advanced options, layered on the profile defaults exactly like the video overrides; the
  resolver maps each codec to its encoder and container (`.opus`/`.m4a`/`.mp3`). Unset
  libraries keep the conservative Opus 128 kbps default. The settings are validated on save
  and carried in config export/import. New nullable `Library.AudioTargetCodec`/
  `AudioBitrateKbps` columns (additive migration; re-running it is a no-op).
- Fixed the optimisation marker not surviving in `.m4a`/`.m4b` (AAC) outputs — they now get
  the same MP4 metadata flag as `.mp4`, so an AAC-target audio file is recognised and never
  re-optimised.

### Audio optimisation (Phase 10)

- **Lossless audio files can now be optimised** through the same safe pipeline as video.
  A lossless source (FLAC, ALAC, PCM/WAV, APE, WavPack, TrueHD, …) is offered as a candidate
  to re-encode to **Opus 128 kbps**; already-lossy audio (MP3, AAC, …) is left untouched to
  avoid generational quality loss, and audio already in Opus or below a small size threshold
  is skipped with a clear reason.
- The whole pipeline is honoured: the transcode copies embedded cover art and all metadata
  and stamps the optimisation marker; verification runs the audio-appropriate gates (decode
  health, duration, audio-track retention, channel-layout fidelity, size, and the opt-in
  loudness/clipping gates) while skipping video-only ones; the verified output only replaces
  the original on the usual explicit, reversible Replace action. The audio re-encode is
  allowed to normalise the sample rate (Opus is always 48 kHz) without tripping the fidelity
  gate. The target is a conservative fixed default for now; per-library audio rules come next.

### Media-kind detection (Phase 10 groundwork)

- Every probed file is now classified as **video, audio, or image** (or unknown) by a pure,
  unit-tested `MediaKindClassifier`, and the kind is stored on the file and shown as a new
  **Kind** column in the Inventory. This is the first step toward optimising audio and
  images through the same safe pipeline as video.
- Detection is robust about **embedded cover art**: an audio file's album art is an
  attached-picture stream, not real video, so such files are correctly classified as audio
  (and the cover no longer leaks in as the file's "video codec"). Still images are
  recognised by extension since they probe as a one-frame video stream. New nullable-safe
  `MediaFile.MediaKind` column (additive migration defaulting existing rows to `Unknown`
  until re-probed; re-running it is a no-op).
- Candidate evaluation is now **media-kind aware**: audio and image files report an honest
  "not available yet" skip reason instead of looking like a probe failure, and the dispatch
  is structured so the upcoming audio/image rules slot straight in. Video is unchanged.
- Groundwork for the audio pipeline: a pure, unit-tested audio branch in the ffmpeg command
  builder and transcode-spec resolver re-encodes audio to an efficient default (Opus 128 kbps)
  while copying embedded cover art and metadata untouched and carrying the optimisation
  marker.
- Verification is now **media-kind aware**: an audio job runs the decode, duration,
  audio-retention, size, and (opt-in) loudness/clipping gates, and skips the video-only ones
  (video-stream-present, HDR, colour, A/V sync, timestamp/tail integrity, VMAF). Audio is
  still gated at the candidate layer, so no audio job runs yet — the safety gates are in
  place for when it is switched on.

### Settings is tabbed, and Tools lives inside it

- The Settings page is now organised into tabs — **General** (the core queue, verification,
  and replacement options the single Save button persists together), **Activity**,
  **Notifications**, **Connections** (Sonarr/Radarr), **Tools**, and **Backup** — so each
  concern is one click away instead of a long scroll.
- **Tools (FFmpeg/ffprobe status, hardware acceleration, encoders) has moved out of its own
  sidebar entry into a Settings tab.** The hardware panel is now a reusable `ToolsPanel`
  component. The old `/tools` link still works — it lands on Settings with the Tools tab
  open — so nothing breaks.

### Clear finished jobs from the Queue

- The Queue page has a **Clear finished** button that removes completed, failed, and
  cancelled jobs so the list doesn't grow without bound. Re-optimisation of the cleared
  files stays blocked by the embedded optimisation marker, so losing the history rows is
  safe.
- **A job whose original is still in quarantine is never cleared** — it is the live
  rollback path, and the safety standard requires keeping it. Such a job becomes clearable
  only once its replacement has been rolled back or purged; the pure, unit-tested
  `JobClearing` rule enforces this, backed by the restrict foreign key.

### Files carry proof they were optimised (durable re-optimisation guard)

- Every optimised output is now **stamped with an `optimisarr` tag in its container
  metadata** (a re-encode and a remux alike). The probe reads that tag back into the
  inventory, and the candidate evaluator skips any file that carries it — first and
  unconditionally, ahead of every other rule.
- Unlike the database job-history guard (which is local and can be cleared), the mark
  **travels with the file**: move the media to another machine, reinstall Optimisarr, or
  clear the queue, and the file is still recognised and never transcoded a second time.
  The two guards are complementary — history catches files this instance handled; the
  embedded mark catches everything, everywhere.
- MP4/MOV outputs get the muxer flag needed for custom tags to round-trip; Matroska and
  others preserve them by default. New nullable `MediaFile.OptimisedMarker` column (additive
  migration; re-running it is a no-op). Marker key and all gate logic are pure and unit
  tested.

### Verification: decode-timestamp monotonicity and truncated-tail gates

- Verification now checks the converted output's **video decode timestamps are
  monotonic**. A new pure, unit-tested `PacketTimestampParser` reads ffprobe's
  per-packet timestamp stream and tallies any decode timestamp that steps backward; a
  `TimestampIntegrityCheck` gathers it with a cheap metadata-only probe (no decode).
  Out-of-order packets can stall or desync playback even on a file that otherwise
  decodes, so any regression fails verification and blocks replacement.
- The same single packet probe now also gates **tail integrity (truncated/partial last
  GOP)**: it tracks the output's latest presentation time — where the video genuinely
  ends — and fails the job when that falls materially short of the source runtime (over a
  second and over 2%, tolerances chosen to absorb last-frame and B-frame reorder slack).
  This catches the dangerous case the duration gate cannot: a truncated encode whose
  container header still claims the full length. Both gates are always on when the
  output's packet timestamps are readable and simply abstain when they are not, never
  blocking on missing evidence. **This completes Phase 9's container/stream-integrity
  checks.**

### UI polish and iOS Safari fix

- Fixed the white strips that appeared at the top and bottom of the app in iOS Safari:
  the document background is now painted in the theme colour (so safe-area insets and
  rubber-band overscroll no longer reveal white), the shell uses the dynamic viewport
  height (`100dvh`) and honours the notch/home-indicator safe areas (`viewport-fit=cover`),
  and `theme-color`/`color-scheme` follow light and dark.
- Buttons, banners, and empty states across the Libraries page now carry consistent icons
  (add, scan, enqueue, configure, delete, save/cancel, success/error), with a friendlier
  empty state and a spinning indicator while a scan runs.
- Status messages and empty states are now shared `Banner` (error/success/info, with a
  leading icon) and `EmptyState` components, replacing the per-page inline markup so every
  page's error/success banner looks and behaves the same.
- The sidebar application mark is now much larger when expanded (and a touch larger when
  collapsed), with the responsive `srcset`/`sizes` hints updated so the bigger logo still
  renders crisply on hi-DPI displays.

### Simpler library configuration

- The per-library form now leads with just the essentials — name, path, media type, and a
  preset with a plain-language summary of what it does — so adding a library is a few
  clicks. Every technical knob (target codec/container, HDR handling, encoder preset,
  quality, VMAF thresholds, resolution/size limits, exclude paths, and move-on-complete)
  is tucked behind a single **Advanced options** disclosure, which opens automatically when
  you edit a library that already uses one of them.
- Numeric settings are now **sliders** instead of raw fields: queue priority is a
  Lowest–Highest slider with a live label, quality (CRF) shows a Smaller↔Sharper scale, and
  the VMAF gate override is a toggle that reveals Average/Worst-frame sliders. Booleans are
  toggles throughout. No behaviour or saved values change — only how they're presented.

### Per-library automatic optimisation

- A library can now **scan and enqueue itself automatically** on a daily schedule, turning
  Optimisarr into a set-and-forget optimiser. Each library has an opt-in auto-enqueue
  toggle and a **daily time window**; a pure, unit-tested `AutoEnqueueScheduleEvaluator`
  fires it **once per window occurrence** (equal start/end means all day, i.e. once daily;
  a 01:00–06:00 window runs a single nightly scan-and-enqueue when it opens, including
  windows that cross midnight). A new `AutoEnqueueWorker` background service does the
  scan → enqueue and stamps `LastAutoEnqueueAt`, surfaced on each library card.
- Automation changes **nothing about safety or limits**: the worker only *creates queued
  jobs*, never starts them. Execution stays with the single-writer `QueueDispatcher`, so
  several libraries enqueuing at once still honour the **global concurrency limit** and the
  **global processing window**, and the existing idempotent enqueue + history guard mean a
  repeated run never duplicates a job or re-optimises a file. The schedule is editable per
  library and carried in config export/import.

### Sidebar brand, build version, and cyan palette

- The sidebar now leads with a **large, centred application mark** that scales
  gracefully — a bigger logo when expanded, a compact badge when collapsed — served
  from a responsive `BrandMark` whose `srcset` lets the browser pick the sharpest icon
  for the rendered size and the display's pixel density.
- The current **build version (git short hash)** is shown at the bottom of the sidebar,
  linking to the matching commit, with the full `version+hash` on hover. It is injected
  at build time by Vite (`__GIT_HASH__`/`__APP_VERSION__`); the Docker web stage has no
  `.git`, so the hash is passed in as a `GIT_HASH` build arg (wired through CI from
  `github.sha`) and falls back to `unknown` when unavailable.
- The accent palette is retuned from emerald to **cyan** to match the application icon's
  glowing cube — active navigation, primary buttons, focus rings, toggles, sliders, and
  progress fills now read cyan, while green/red are reserved for pass/fail and other
  status, so success and "selected" are no longer the same colour.

### Don't optimise the same file twice

- A file that has already been optimised — or that already failed — for its current
  version is no longer offered as a candidate or re-queued, so the queue can't loop on
  the same file (which previously affected failed jobs and the move-on-complete flow,
  where the original never changes). The rule is version-aware via a pure, unit-tested
  `OptimisationHistoryEvaluator`: a job only counts if it finished at or after the
  file's modified time, so a genuinely changed file (a fresh rip) becomes eligible
  again. The Candidates list explains why with "Already optimised" or "Previously
  failed".
- Failed and cancelled jobs can be **retried** from the queue (`POST /api/jobs/{id}/retry`),
  which re-queues the file as a fresh attempt — the deliberate way to re-run a file the
  history guard is holding back. The Queue page surfaces this with a **Retry** action on
  failed/cancelled rows, status **filter chips** (All / Active / Completed / Failed with
  live counts), an inline failure reason instead of a bare "error" label, and a shared
  inline-SVG `Icon` set on the row actions.

### libvmaf-enabled ffmpeg and PSNR/SSIM

- The image now bundles **jellyfin-ffmpeg** (a Debian-packaged ffmpeg with libvmaf and
  its models, plus hardware encoders) and points the quality/loudness measurement at
  it via `OPTIMISARR_FFMPEG_VMAF`, so the VMAF and EBU R128 gates actually run. The
  proven Debian ffmpeg still drives transcoding and probing, so enabling the gates
  never disturbs the existing encode path.
- The VMAF pass now also computes **PSNR and SSIM** in the same run, surfaced in the
  verification report alongside VMAF as corroborating quality signals.

### Per-library VMAF thresholds

- A library can now override the perceptual-quality (VMAF) gate's harmonic-mean and
  worst-frame thresholds, so an archive library can demand near-lossless quality
  while a space-saver accepts more — resolved per job by a pure, unit-tested
  `VerificationPolicyResolver` that falls back to the global thresholds when no
  override is set (and only when the gate is enabled). Editable on each library and
  carried in config export/import.

### True-peak clipping detection

- An opt-in **true-peak clipping** gate now catches a re-encode that introduces clipping.
  The `ebur128` measurement runs with `peak=true`, so the output's true peak comes from
  the same decode the loudness gate already does — no extra pass. A pure, unit-tested
  parser reads the dBTP value and the evaluator fails the job only when the output rises
  above a configurable ceiling (default 0 dBTP) *and* is hotter than the original, so a
  source that was already clipping is never blamed on the re-encode. The gate fails closed
  if the true peak can't be measured, is configurable from Settings (with a negative
  ceiling like −1 dBTP allowed for a stricter margin), and is carried in config
  export/import.

### Colour metadata and A/V sync integrity

- Verification now compares the output's **colour primaries, transfer, and matrix**
  against the original and fails a definite mismatch (e.g. BT.709 re-tagged as
  BT.601); a dropped tag is treated as benign. It also checks **A/V sync** from the
  output's video and audio start times, failing only a gross offset (> 0.5 s) so
  normal priming offsets don't trip it. Both reuse existing probe data, are pure and
  unit tested, and only run when the relevant metadata is present.

### Audio fidelity checks

- Verification now guards audio. An always-on **channel/sample-rate retention** gate
  (when audio retention is required) fails a job that silently downmixes — e.g. 5.1 to
  stereo — or drops the sample rate, reusing a quick re-probe of the original for no
  decode cost. An opt-in **EBU R128 loudness** gate measures the integrated loudness of
  the original and output with FFmpeg's `ebur128` filter and fails the job if they
  drift beyond a configurable tolerance (default 1 LU); it adds a decode pass per file
  so it is off by default and fails closed if loudness can't be measured. The loudness
  parsing and both gate decisions are pure and unit tested.

### Never silently strip HDR

- Verification now includes an always-on **HDR preservation** gate: if the original
  carries an HDR signal (HDR10/HDR10+/HLG transfer or Dolby Vision side data) and the
  library is set to preserve it, the output must still be HDR or the job fails — so a
  transcode can never quietly drop HDR. When the library intentionally tone-maps HDR
  to SDR, the gate passes; SDR originals are unaffected. It reuses the existing probe
  data, so it adds no extra FFmpeg work, and the decision is pure and unit tested.

### Perceptual quality gate (VMAF)

- Verification can now measure the output's **perceptual quality against the
  original with FFmpeg's libvmaf** (VMAF, plus PSNR/SSIM when the build reports
  them) and gate replacement on it. It is **opt-in** — measuring VMAF needs an
  ffmpeg built with libvmaf and roughly doubles verification time — and configured
  on Settings with two floors: a **harmonic-mean** VMAF (penalises bad frames) and
  a **per-frame minimum** (catches short artifact bursts a healthy average hides),
  defaulting to 93 and 80.
- The libvmaf JSON parsing (`QualityScoreParser`) and the gate decision
  (`VerificationEvaluator`) are pure and unit tested against captured output; the
  measured numbers are shown in the verification report. The gate **fails closed**:
  if quality cannot be measured (e.g. an ffmpeg without libvmaf) the check fails so
  an unproven output is never allowed to replace an original. The distorted stream
  is scaled to the reference (`scale2ref`) so a downscaled encode is still compared
  like-for-like. Note: Debian's stock ffmpeg lacks libvmaf, so the gate needs a
  libvmaf-enabled ffmpeg in the image (tracked as a Phase 9 infra follow-up).

### Don't fight Sonarr/Radarr imports

- Connect **Sonarr** and **Radarr** (base URL + API key, key write-only) on the
  Settings page. Before queueing a library, Optimisarr asks each connected manager
  which titles it is currently importing (via `/api/v3/queue` with the title
  embedded) and **holds back any file whose folder an import is landing in**, so a
  transcode never competes with — or is overwritten by — an import. Held-back files
  become eligible again on the next enqueue once the import settles, and the enqueue
  summary reports how many were held back.
- The queue parsing (`ArrQueueParser`) and the segment-aware path match
  (`ArrImportExclusionEvaluator`) are pure and unit tested. Querying is best-effort
  and self-isolating: a manager that is offline, rejects the key, or returns junk
  contributes no exclusions and never wedges the queue, exactly like the streaming
  activity-pause gate. Connections are included in config export/import (without the
  key).

### Export and import your configuration

- A new **Backup & restore** section on Settings exports your settings, libraries,
  activity watchers, and notification targets to a JSON file, and imports one back.
  For safety, **provider tokens are never exported** — the file carries no
  credentials, so it is safe to store or share, and tokens are re-entered after
  importing.
- Import is **validated in full before anything is written** (schema version,
  recognised setting keys, valid enums and required fields) by a pure, unit-tested
  `ConfigSnapshotValidator`, so a malformed or newer-than-supported file is rejected
  whole. It then applies as a **non-destructive merge**: libraries are matched on
  path, watchers and targets on name, so importing never deletes existing
  configuration and never overwrites a stored token with a blank.

### Notifications on replacement and failure

- Optimisarr can now POST to a **webhook**, an **ntfy** topic, or an **Apprise**
  endpoint when a file is replaced or a job fails. Targets are managed on the
  Settings page, each with its own URL, optional bearer token (write-only — stored
  but never returned), and per-event toggles so you can be alerted on failures only,
  replacements only, or both.
- Message rendering (`NotificationMessages`) and per-type request shaping
  (`NotificationRequestBuilder` — JSON for webhook/Apprise, plain text with a Title
  header for ntfy) are pure and unit tested. Delivery is **best-effort**: it runs
  after the replacement is committed or the job is already marked failed, with a 10s
  timeout, so a target that is offline or rejects the POST is logged and never
  affects processing.

### Sign in to Plex and Jellyfin instead of pasting a token

- Adding a Plex or Jellyfin watcher no longer requires hunting down a raw token.
  **Sign in with Plex** runs Plex's OAuth/PIN flow — Optimisarr creates a PIN,
  opens `app.plex.tv` for you to approve, and polls until Plex issues a token,
  which it fills into the form. **Quick Connect** does the Jellyfin equivalent:
  it shows a code to enter in your Jellyfin session and polls until you approve,
  then exchanges it for an access token. Emby keeps the manual API key (it has no
  comparable flow), and pasting a token by hand still works for all three.
- Plex ties an issued token to a client identifier, so Optimisarr generates a
  stable one once (`connect.plexClientIdentifier`) and reuses it across the
  create-PIN and poll steps and across restarts. The JSON parsing for both flows
  (`PlexPinParser`, `JellyfinQuickConnectParser`) is pure and unit tested; the
  `/api/connect/*` endpoints report a provider that can't be reached as a 502.

### Refresh media servers after a replacement

- After a verified replacement (and after a rollback), Optimisarr now asks the
  connected media servers to re-scan the changed title, so Plex/Jellyfin/Emby pick
  up the new file without waiting for their own scheduled scan. It reuses the same
  server connections configured for activity-pause — configure each server once.
- A new **Refresh after replacements** toggle on each watcher (default on) controls
  this; the watcher list shows a "refresh" badge for enabled targets. Plex is asked
  to refresh its sections (`/library/sections/all/refresh`); Jellyfin and Emby are
  notified of the changed folder via `/Library/Media/Updated` so the scan is
  targeted. The request shaping is a pure, unit-tested `LibraryRefreshRequestBuilder`.
- The refresh is strictly **best-effort**: it runs only after the replacement is
  already safely committed, and a server that is offline or rejects the call is
  logged and ignored — it can never affect the replacement's outcome or safety.

### Pause processing while a media server is streaming

- New **activity watchers** let Optimisarr pause the queue while Plex, Jellyfin, or
  Emby has active playback, so a transcode never competes with someone's stream.
  Running jobs are never interrupted — the gate only decides whether *new* jobs may
  start, alongside the existing processing-window and free-disk gates, and the
  pause reason ("Paused while Living room Plex is active (1 stream)") shows on the
  Queue page.
- Watchers are a dedicated table with CRUD on the Settings page (type, base URL,
  token/API key, enabled). Tokens are write-only — they are stored but never
  returned to the browser, and a blank token on edit keeps the stored secret. Plex
  is polled via `/status/sessions` (XML) and Jellyfin/Emby via the shared
  MediaBrowser `/Sessions` (JSON); a session counts only when it is actually
  playing something.
- The parsing (`PlexSessionsParser`, `JellyfinSessionsParser`) and the pause
  decision (`ActivityPauseEvaluator`) are pure and unit tested. An **unreachable**
  server is treated as not-active on purpose, so one offline server or a stale
  token can never wedge the queue. `ActivityMonitor` caches results briefly so the
  dispatch loop and status endpoint share one set of HTTP calls.

### Quarantine retention: purge old originals

- The `replacement.quarantineRetentionDays` setting is now enforced. A background
  worker sweeps quarantine on startup and every six hours, and once a replaced
  original has sat in quarantine longer than the configured window it is deleted
  and its replacement is marked **Purged** (recorded with a `PurgedAt` timestamp,
  added by a new additive migration). The default of `0` keeps originals
  indefinitely, so nothing is ever purged until a retention window is set.
- The decision of which originals have expired is a pure, unit-tested
  `QuarantineRetentionEvaluator`; the `QuarantinePurgeService` only ever touches
  `Replaced` rows and is best-effort about a file that is already gone, so a
  failed delete never aborts the sweep. Purging deliberately discards the rollback
  path — the Quarantine page shows a Purged badge, drops the Roll back action, and
  notes that purged originals can no longer be restored.

### Live queue progress over SignalR

- The Queue page now subscribes to the jobs SignalR hub instead of only polling:
  the server pushes live transcode telemetry and the UI updates instantly (a slow
  poll remains as a safety net and to refresh free-disk/running counts).
- Transcoding rows show a determinate bar with **encode speed and ETA**, parsed
  from FFmpeg's stderr by a new pure, unit-tested `FfmpegProgressParser`. The
  probing and verifying phases show an indeterminate sweep, and queued rows read
  "waiting" — every phase now communicates state instead of a bare dash.
- Added a `jobProgress` hub event carrying `{ progress, fps, speed, etaSeconds }`
  so telemetry streams without a database round-trip; `job.Progress` is still
  persisted for durability.

### UI: consistent control primitives

- Polished and unified the form controls into a small, consistent set: every
  button, input, select, and checkbox now shares one emerald focus ring, selects
  draw a custom chevron instead of the raw OS widget, and a new `Toggle` switch
  replaces bare checkboxes for on/off feature settings (with the whole row
  clickable and keyboard-operable). Added a `.btn-ghost` variant, replacing the
  ad-hoc `!border-0 !bg-transparent` overrides in the sidebar and folder picker.
- Simplified the Settings page: the two duplicate Save buttons became a single
  Save action, and Replacement moved out of the Verification card into its own
  section so each card covers one concern.

### Safe replacement: cross-filesystem guard

- Replacement now refuses by default to fall back to a cross-filesystem
  copy-plus-delete, since the atomic rename is what makes quarantine-then-replace
  safe. A new `replacement.allowCrossFilesystem` setting opts into the fallback
  for intentional split-mount layouts, and `replacement.quarantineRetentionDays`
  records how long quarantined originals are kept (`0` = indefinitely). Both are
  stored in `AppSettings` (no migration) and exposed on the Settings page.

### Phase 6: scheduling and resource controls

- Added queue dispatch policy controls for processing windows and free disk
  safety. The worker now checks the configured local processing window and the
  free space on the work filesystem before starting new jobs; running jobs are
  not interrupted by these gates.
- Expanded global settings with `scheduleEnabled`, `scheduleWindowStart`,
  `scheduleWindowEnd`, and `minFreeDiskBytes`. These are stored in the existing
  `AppSettings` table, so no schema migration is required.
- Added `GET /api/queue/status`, exposing whether dispatch can currently start
  work, the blocked reason, running/max jobs, work root, and measured free disk
  space.
- Added a global CPU thread limit setting, wired into generated FFmpeg arguments
  as `-threads`; `0` leaves thread selection to FFmpeg.
- Added hardware capability detection for FFmpeg hardware accelerators, known
  CPU/NVENC/QSV/VAAPI encoders, NVIDIA runtime availability, and `/dev/dri`
  mapping. Surfaced through `GET /api/system/hardware` and the Tools page.
- Added global encoder mode selection (`Auto`, `CPU`, `NVIDIA NVENC`, `Intel QSV`,
  `VAAPI`). The worker validates the requested mode against detected FFmpeg
  encoders before starting a job and uses the selected encoder in generated
  FFmpeg arguments.
- Added configurable verification policy settings for duration tolerance, audio
  retention, subtitle retention, and required size reduction. Decode health,
  output readability, and video-stream presence remain mandatory safety gates.
- UI: the Settings page now edits the processing window and minimum free work
  disk threshold plus encoder mode, CPU thread limit, and verification gates; the
  Queue page shows whether dispatch is ready or paused.
- Added tests for the new settings defaults, persistence, and invalid-value
  fallback, building on the pure `DispatchPolicyEvaluator` tests.
- Fixed hardware encoders being reported as available purely because FFmpeg was
  built with them, which made `Auto` mode pick `hevc_nvenc` on a host with no
  usable GPU and fail every job immediately (`Cannot load libcuda.so.1`). A
  hardware encoder is now only available when the hardware is actually usable:
  NVENC requires a working NVIDIA runtime and QSV/VAAPI require a DRI render
  device, so `Auto` correctly falls back to CPU when no GPU is present.

### Phase 5: safe replacement and rollback

- A verified `ReadyToReplace` job can now replace its original — the first
  destructive action in Optimisarr, and a fully reversible one. The original is
  moved to **quarantine** (`/trash`) *first*, then the verified output is moved
  into the original's place; the move is recorded as a `Replacement` so it can be
  rolled back. If any step fails, the original is restored from quarantine, so a
  failure never loses data.
- The output takes the original's directory and base name but the output's
  extension (a transcode may change container, e.g. `.avi` → `.mkv`), computed by
  the pure, unit-tested `ReplacementPlanner`. Quarantine paths are timestamped so
  same-named files never collide and rollback always has a unique source.
- Cross-filesystem aware: an atomic rename is used when source and destination
  share a filesystem; otherwise a **verified copy-plus-delete** runs (the source is
  removed only after the copy exists and its size matches). The fallback is
  recorded and surfaced in the UI as a "copied" badge.
- After replacement a final-path integrity check confirms the placed file matches
  the verified output, and the inventory is re-probed from the file now at the
  original's location. The job moves to `Completed`.
- **Rollback** restores the original from quarantine and removes the replacement
  output; the `Replacement` is marked `RolledBack`. Originals are retained in
  quarantine (never auto-purged) so rollback stays available.
- Added the `Replacement` entity (`AddReplacements` migration) and endpoints:
  `POST /api/jobs/{id}/replace`, `GET /api/replacements`,
  `POST /api/replacements/{id}/rollback`.
- UI: the **Quarantine** page (nav enabled) lists replacements with size saving,
  cross-filesystem indicator, and a roll-back action; the **Queue** page gained a
  **Replace** action on verified `ReadyToReplace` jobs.
- The compose example documents putting `/trash` on the same filesystem as `/data`
  so replacement can use an atomic move.

### Phase 4: verification

- A clean ffmpeg exit no longer sends a job straight to `ReadyToReplace`. The
  worker now runs a real **`Verifying`** step first: a full software-decode health
  check (`ffmpeg -v error -xerror -i <output> -f null -`, via the new
  `DecodeHealthCheck`), an ffprobe of the output, and a comparison against the
  original. Only a passing report advances the job toward replacement; a failing
  report marks the job `Failed` with the failed gate names, **retaining the output
  for inspection**. The original is never touched either way.
- Added a pure, fully unit-tested `VerificationEvaluator` (in `Optimisarr.Core`)
  that turns gathered evidence into a `VerificationReport` of per-check outcomes:
  decode health, output readable, video stream present, duration within tolerance,
  audio retention, subtitle retention, and size saving. Thresholds live in a
  conservative `VerificationPolicy.Default` (1% duration tolerance, audio must be
  retained, output must be smaller; subtitle retention off by default).
- Added `VerificationService` (the only place verification touches FFmpeg/disk),
  which gathers the decode + probe results and hands them to the pure evaluator.
- Persisted the result on the job: `OutputSizeBytes`, `VerificationPassed`,
  `VerificationReportJson`, and `VerifiedAt` (`AddJobVerification` migration,
  additive and backwards-safe). Surfaced through `GET /api/jobs`.
- UI: the **Queue** page gained a Verification column showing pass/fail and the
  output size, expandable to the full per-check report with reasons.

### Phase 3: transcode queue (worker)

- Added `JobEnqueueService` + `POST /api/libraries/{id}/enqueue`, which turns a
  library's eligible candidates into queued jobs. Idempotent: a media file with an
  active (non-terminal) job is never enqueued twice.
- Added `QueueDispatcher`, a `BackgroundService` that drives the queue: a single
  loop owns all job-state writes (SQLite has one writer), selects work via the
  pure `JobScheduler` up to the global `maxConcurrentJobs`, and runs ffmpeg
  out-of-process through an argument list (never a shell) with a `CancellationToken`
  and captured output. Progress is parsed from ffmpeg and pushed live over SignalR
  (`JobsHub`). A job only ever writes to the work directory; the original is never
  touched (successful jobs land in `ReadyToReplace`, pending safe replacement).
- Crash recovery: on startup, jobs left mid-flight are reset to Queued (or Failed
  after too many attempts) and their partial outputs cleaned up.
- Added `GET /api/jobs` and `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel` (cancelling stops the
  running ffmpeg and marks the job Cancelled).
- UI: new **Queue** page (nav enabled) listing jobs with status, a live progress
  bar for the running transcode, and cancel; it polls while open. Library cards
  gained an **Enqueue** action that queues the library's eligible files.
- Per-library **move-on-complete**: a library can opt to move a finished output
  to a target folder (with the `AddLibraryMoveOnComplete` migration and a pure,
  unit-tested `MoveTarget` resolver). The original is still never touched; this
  only relocates our own work output, falling back to copy+delete across
  filesystems. Off by default — outputs stay in the work directory as
  `ReadyToReplace`. The library form gained a "Completed output" toggle and a
  target-folder picker.
- Fixed `GET /api/jobs` returning HTTP 500 (the Queue page failed to load):
  SQLite cannot translate an `ORDER BY` over the `DateTimeOffset` `EnqueuedAt`
  column, so the priority/enqueue ordering is now applied client-side after
  materialisation. Extracted into `JobQueries.ListAsync` with a regression test.

### Phase 3: transcode queue (foundation)

- Added the `Job` entity and `JobStatus` state machine (Queued → Probing →
  Transcoding → Verifying → ReadyToReplace → Completed, plus Failed/Cancelled),
  with the `AddJobs` migration and indexes for the scheduler's queries. A job
  never touches the original; it only produces an output under `/work`.
- Added a pure, unit-tested `JobScheduler` that selects which queued jobs to start
  given the running count and global concurrency limit, ordered priority-desc then
  FIFO (enqueue time, then id).
- Added a pure, unit-tested `FfmpegCommandBuilder` that emits an ffmpeg argument
  list (never a shell string): codec→encoder mapping (libx265/libx264/libsvtav1),
  CRF and preset, remux-only (`-c copy`), HDR→SDR tone-map filter, `-map 0`, and
  audio/subtitle passthrough.
- Added a pure, unit-tested `TranscodeSpecResolver` that builds a `TranscodeSpec`
  from a library's resolved rules and a media file (work-root output path, target
  codec/container, and tone-map only when re-encoding an HDR source that the
  library asks to tone-map).
- Added per-library encoder settings (`QualityCrf`, `EncoderPreset`) via the
  `AddLibraryEncoderSettings` migration, surfaced in the library config card.
- Polished the library config card: free-text fields are now dropdowns (target
  codec, container, encoder preset, HDR handling, resolution limit, priority),
  quality is a CRF slider with an "encoder default" toggle, and the form is
  grouped into "Target output" and "Eligibility & queue" sections.
  `GET /api/library-options` now also returns the codec/container/preset vocab.

### Per-library configuration and global queue settings

- Each library can now override how it is optimised, on top of its rule-profile
  preset: target video codec, target container, HDR handling, minimum file size,
  maximum resolution (height), path exclusions, and a queue priority. Overrides
  are resolved by a new pure `RuleResolver` (profile defaults + non-null
  overrides), kept fully unit tested.
- Reworked HDR handling from a boolean into an `HdrHandling` enum
  (`Preserve` / `Exclude` / `TonemapToSdr`); `Exclude` remains the safe default
  for the conservative and compatibility profiles. `RuleSettings` also gained an
  explicit `TargetContainer` (replacing the hard-coded matroska keyword set).
- New `Library` columns (`Priority`, `MinFileSizeBytes`, `MaxHeight`,
  `TargetVideoCodec`, `TargetContainer`, `HdrHandling`, `ExcludePaths`) via the
  `AddLibraryRuleOverrides` migration; all nullable/defaulted, so applying it to
  an existing database is non-destructive.
- `GET /api/candidates` now evaluates each file against its library's resolved
  rules (including overrides). `GET /api/library-options` also returns the HDR
  handling vocabulary.
- New global settings: `GET`/`PUT /api/settings` with `maxConcurrentJobs`
  (default 1), stored via `SettingsStore`. This is the global concurrency limit
  the upcoming transcode queue will honour.
- UI: the Libraries page is now Add-button + expandable cards — each card expands
  to a handling form (preset, target codec/container, HDR, size/resolution
  limits, path exclusions, priority). New global **Settings** page for the
  concurrency limit; the Settings nav item is now enabled.

### Phase 2: candidate rules

- Added a pure, fully unit-tested eligibility engine in `Optimisarr.Core`
  (`CandidateEvaluator`) that decides whether a probed file should be optimised
  under a rule profile — without ever running FFmpeg. Every decision carries a
  human-readable reason, so the UI can always explain why a file is eligible or
  skipped. Checks: no video stream, path exclusions, HDR/Dolby Vision exclusion,
  minimum file size, resolution limit, already-target-codec, and (for
  remux/cleanup) already-clean container.
- Each `RuleProfile` resolves to concrete `RuleSettings` via `RuleProfileDefaults`
  (HEVC/H264/AV1 targets, remux-only has no target codec; conservative profiles
  exclude HDR by default).
- Moved the domain enums `MediaType` and `RuleProfile` from `Optimisarr.Data` to
  `Optimisarr.Core` (`Optimisarr.Core.Domain`) so rules logic owns its vocabulary.
  Stored as strings, so no migration was required.
- Probing now detects HDR/HLG (transfer characteristics) and Dolby Vision (stream
  side data); persisted via the new `MediaFile.IsHdr` column
  (`AddMediaFileIsHdr` migration, non-destructive default `false`).
- New endpoint `GET /api/candidates` (optional `libraryId` filter) backed by
  `CandidateService`, which evaluates each probed file against its library's
  profile. New **Candidates** page in the UI with all/eligible/skipped filters
  and a per-file reason column.

### Continuous integration (Node 24)

- Opted CI into Node 24 for JavaScript-based actions
  (`FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24`) ahead of GitHub forcing it on
  2026-06-16, and verified the pipeline passes on Node 24.

### Multiple libraries with per-library rules

- Replaced the single `library.root` setting with a first-class `Library`
  entity: each library has a name, path, media type (Film/Tv/Music/Other) and
  rule profile (ConservativeHevc/CompatibilityH264/ExperimentalAv1/RemuxCleanup),
  so different content can be optimised by different rules. Rule enforcement
  lands in Phase 2; profiles are stored per library now.
- `MediaFile` now belongs to a `Library` (nullable FK, cascade delete). The
  `LibraryId` is nullable so the schema applies to an existing database without
  a foreign-key violation; scans always set it.
- Added the `AddLibraries` migration and an idempotent startup seeder that
  migrates any pre-existing `library.root` into a default library and relinks
  already-discovered files to it.
- New endpoints: `GET /api/libraries`, `POST /api/libraries`,
  `PUT/DELETE /api/libraries/{id}`, `POST /api/libraries/{id}/scan`,
  `POST /api/libraries/scan` (all enabled), `GET /api/library-options`, and
  `GET /api/fs/browse` for directory browsing. `GET /api/media` accepts an
  optional `libraryId` filter.
- Added tests for library-scoped scanning, idempotency, and cascade delete.

### Web UI redesign (yawamf-style sidebar)

- Rebuilt the frontend around a collapsible sidebar shell with dark mode and
  hash-based routing (Tailwind CSS v4 via the Vite plugin).
- Pages: Dashboard, Libraries (add/edit/scan/delete), Inventory (per-library
  filter + probe), Tools. Queue/Verification/Quarantine/Schedule/Settings appear
  as disabled "soon" items to show the roadmap.
- Library paths are chosen with a folder-picker dialog (backed by
  `GET /api/fs/browse`) instead of free-text entry.

### Continuous integration

- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: backend build (`-warnaserror`) and tests,
  frontend `npm run check`, and a Docker image build.
- The Docker job publishes to GHCR as `ghcr.io/jellman86/optimisarr` using the
  built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no PAT required): `dev` -> `:dev`, `main` ->
  `:main` and `:latest`, and `vX.Y.Z` tags -> semver tags. Pull requests build
  the image but never push.
- Fixed the `Dockerfile` to copy `Optimisarr.slnx` (the repo uses the `.slnx`
  solution format); it previously referenced a non-existent `Optimisarr.sln`,
  which would have failed the image build.
- Codified the CI/CD process and image-tagging rules in `CLAUDE.md` (§9).
- Added `curl` to the runtime image so container healthchecks (e.g.
  `GET /api/health`) work out of the box.
- Fixed the container failing to start with `exec: "/entrypoint.sh":
  permission denied`: `entrypoint.sh` was tracked as non-executable, so the
  copied file had no execute bit. Copy it with `--chmod=0755` and mark it
  executable in git.

### Engineering standards

- Added `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative engineering standard for the repo
  (safety-first, test-driven development, database excellence and idempotency,
  self-documenting code, clean operational UI, definition of done, local
  commands, and project layout).
- Added `AGENTS.md` pointing all agents and contributors to `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 1: media discovery and inventory (first slice)

- Switched startup database creation from `EnsureCreated` to EF Core migrations
  (`Database.MigrateAsync`) for versioned, idempotent schema management, and
  added the `InitialCreate` migration.
- Added the `MediaFile` entity and `DbSet` with a unique index on `Path`,
  enum-as-string status, and probe-result columns.
- Added `SettingKeys` and a single configurable library root stored in
  `AppSettings`.
- Added `LibraryScanner` (Core): recursive, settling-aware media discovery with
  extension filtering; pure and unit tested.
- Added `MediaProbeService` (Core): ffprobe JSON inspection via an explicit
  argument list, with a unit-tested parser.
- Added `SettingsStore` and `LibraryInventoryService` (Api) for idempotent scan
  upserts and probe persistence.
- Added endpoints: `GET /api/settings`, `PUT /api/settings/library-root`,
  `POST /api/library/scan`, `GET /api/media`, `POST /api/media/{id}/probe`.
- Added a Library/Inventory panel to the Svelte UI: set library root, scan, view
  discovered media, and probe individual files.
- Added xUnit tests for the scanner and ffprobe parser (6 tests, all passing).

### Project setup

- Created the `Jellman86/optimisarr` GitHub repository.
- Created and pushed the `dev` branch.
- Added initial planning documents:
  - `docs/product-and-architecture.md`
  - `docs/roadmap.md`
- Chose the implementation stack:
  - C# / ASP.NET Core on .NET 10 LTS for the backend and worker host.
  - Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite for the frontend.
  - SQLite under `/config` for local state.
  - FFmpeg and ffprobe as external media tools.
  - SignalR reserved for live job and queue updates.
- Installed .NET SDK `10.0.300` locally under `/tmp/dotnet` for this session
  because WSL did not have `dotnet` installed globally.

### Backend scaffold

- Added `Optimisarr.sln`.
- Added .NET 10 projects:
  - `src/Optimisarr.Api`
  - `src/Optimisarr.Core`
  - `src/Optimisarr.Data`
  - `tests/Optimisarr.Tests`
- Added EF Core SQLite package references.
- Added `OptimisarrDbContext` with an initial `AppSetting` table.

  `config/optimisarr.db` outside Docker.
- Replaced template weather endpoint with:
  - `GET /api/health`
  - `GET /api/system/tools`
- Added FFmpeg/ffprobe detection through `ToolDetectionService`.
- Added an empty SignalR `JobsHub` at `/hubs/jobs`.

### Frontend scaffold

- Added Svelte 5 TypeScript app under `web`.
- Replaced the Vite starter page with an Optimisarr status dashboard.
- The dashboard calls:
  - `/api/health`
  - `/api/system/tools`
- Configured Vite to build static assets into
  `src/Optimisarr.Api/wwwroot` so ASP.NET Core can serve the UI.

### Docker scaffold

- Added `.env.example`.
- Added `compose.example.yml` using media-stack style mounts:
  - `/config`
  - `/data`
  - `/work`
  - `/trash`
- Added optional `/dev/dri` mapping for Intel/AMD VAAPI/QSV.
- Documented the NVIDIA Compose GPU reservation block.
- Added a multi-stage Dockerfile:
  - Node 24 builds the Svelte UI.
  - .NET 10 SDK publishes the API.
  - .NET 10 ASP.NET runtime image runs the app.
  - Runtime image installs FFmpeg, ffprobe, gosu, and timezone data.
- Added `docker/entrypoint.sh` with `PUID`, `PGID`, and `UMASK` support.

### Current verification status

- `dotnet build Optimisarr.slnx` succeeds with zero warnings.
- `dotnet test Optimisarr.slnx` is green (6 tests passing).
- `npm run check` is clean (zero errors, zero warnings).
