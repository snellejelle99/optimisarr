/// <summary>
/// The thresholds a converted output must satisfy before a job may move toward
/// replacement. Defaults are conservative: the output must decode cleanly, keep
/// the same duration (within tolerance), retain every audio track, and be smaller
/// than the original. Subtitle retention is not required by default because some
/// rule profiles intentionally drop image-based subtitles.
///
/// The base perceptual-quality (VMAF) policy is off so it remains inapplicable to media that
/// cannot use it. New video re-encode libraries explicitly materialise an enabled, sampled policy;
/// existing libraries retain their saved choice. Full-file, every-frame measurement roughly doubles
/// verification time and can dominate a run on modest hardware. The structural, duration and size
/// gates plus quarantine rollback still protect every replacement while VMAF is off.
/// It is skipped for remuxes and non-video media, where VMAF has no useful work to do.
/// When enabled, the output must clear a harmonic-mean VMAF floor, a fifth-percentile
/// floor for sustained difficult content, and a lower single-frame catastrophic floor.
///
/// The audio loudness and clipping gates are opt-in too and share one
/// <c>ebur128</c> decode pass: the loudness gate bounds EBU R128 drift, and the
/// clipping gate fails an output whose true peak rises above the ceiling when the
/// original sat below it — i.e. the re-encode introduced clipping.
///
/// The image-quality gate is the still-image counterpart of VMAF: it is on by default
/// (measuring it runs ffmpeg's <c>ssim</c> filter over the original and output
/// pictures) and, when enabled, blocks replacement when the structural similarity
/// of the re-encoded still falls below a floor. SSIM (not VMAF) is the image metric
/// because VMAF is tuned for moving video, while SSIM is a well-understood
/// structural measure for a single frame.
///
/// The image-metadata gate is also on by default: when enabled it fails an image whose
/// re-encode silently dropped the source's embedded ICC colour profile or its EXIF
/// metadata. Some encoders/containers discard these by default, which can shift
/// colours or lose capture data, so a colour-sensitive library can demand they
/// survive. The gate only flags *loss* — an output may gain metadata (Optimisarr
/// stamps its own marker) without failing.
