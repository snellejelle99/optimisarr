# Optimisarr Product and Architecture

## Product intent

Optimisarr is a safe media library optimiser for self-hosted users who want the
space savings of automated transcoding without trusting a black-box tool to
rewrite their library.

The core promise is:

> Optimisarr never deletes or replaces an original until the converted file has
> passed explicit verification gates.

## Target user

- Runs Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Sonarr, Radarr, or a similar media stack.
- Uses Docker Compose or Unraid-style Docker templates.
- Has media bind-mounted into containers.
- Wants scheduled background conversion using CPU or GPU.
- Cares about preserving subtitles, audio tracks, HDR metadata, and playback
  compatibility.

## MVP scope

### In scope

- Single Docker container.
- Svelte 5 web interface.
- ASP.NET Core minimal-API backend.
- SQLite state stored under `/config`.
- FFmpeg and ffprobe based scanning, probing, transcoding, and verification.
- Configurable library roots mounted under `/data`.
- Work directory for temporary outputs mounted under `/work`.
- Quarantine/trash directory for originals mounted under `/trash`.
- Scheduler windows, pause/resume, and queue priorities.
- GPU capability detection and encoder selection.
- Safe replacement pipeline:
  1. Probe original.
  2. Decide whether the file is eligible.
  3. Transcode to `/work`.
  4. Probe output.
  5. Run health verification.
  6. Compare stream policy.
  7. Replace original atomically when possible.
  8. Move original to quarantine.
  9. Record rollback metadata.

The timed retention sweep runs at startup and every six hours. One cleanup window
covers quarantined originals and failed `/work` outputs. It never removes active or
ready-to-replace work; expired failed scratch is detached from its retained job row
so reports and FFmpeg evidence remain queryable. The settings preview and manual
cleanup endpoint use the same eligibility checks; the manual path re-evaluates its
plan at execution time, refuses a stale browser confirmation, and reports bytes
actually reclaimed.

### Out of scope for MVP

- Distributed workers were outside the original MVP. Optional registered Windows and macOS
  sidecars are now available as an opt-in preview; the main container remains the safety authority
  and the complete single-host default (see [remote workers](setup/remote-workers.md)).
- Cloud storage.
- Full plugin marketplace.
- Automatic download client integration.
- Multi-user RBAC.
- Commercial post-production workflows.

## Differentiation

Existing tools are powerful but either broad, complex, or insufficiently
focused on safe replacement.

- Unmanic is open source and plugin-driven, but its strength is broad library
  processing rather than a safety-first replacement workflow.
- Tdarr has mature health checks and worker orchestration, but the server/node
  model and plugin stacks are heavy for a single-host home-lab deployment.
- FileFlows is a powerful general file-processing platform, but its flow-builder
  model is broader than the focused media-library optimisation problem.
- HandBrake Web and docker-handbrake are strong batch/manual transcoders, but
  they are not primarily library-replacement tools.

Optimisarr should win by being boring, predictable, and explicit about what it
will and will not modify.

## Recommended tech stack

### Runtime architecture

Use one container with one ASP.NET Core host:

- ASP.NET Core serves the JSON API, SignalR progress updates, health endpoints,
  and built Svelte assets.
- Background services run scanner, scheduler, and worker loops in the same host.
- SQLite-backed job leases prevent duplicate work and make interrupted jobs
  recoverable after restarts.
- FFmpeg and ffprobe run as child processes with explicit argument arrays,
  cancellation tokens, and captured stdout/stderr.

This avoids multi-container complexity while using the .NET host model for the
parts this app depends on most: long-running background tasks, graceful shutdown,
typed configuration, structured logging, and real-time UI updates.

### Backend

- C# on current LTS .NET.
- ASP.NET Core minimal APIs.
- SignalR for live job progress and queue updates.
- `BackgroundService`/`IHostedService` for scanner, scheduler, and worker loops.
- EF Core with SQLite in `/config/optimisarr.db`.
- Fluent validation or built-in options validation for settings.
- Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging JSON console logs.
- FFmpeg/ffprobe invoked through `System.Diagnostics.Process`, never through
  shell interpolation.

Why C#/.NET:

- The application is closer to a daemon than a simple request/response API.
- ASP.NET Core has first-class hosted background services.
- SignalR gives a clean real-time channel for progress, logs, and queue changes.
- EF Core plus SQLite gives typed persistence and migrations without an external
  database.
- Strong typing helps keep media stream policies, replacement decisions, and
  verification results explicit and testable.
- Official .NET container images are well supported and multi-arch friendly.

Tradeoffs:

- Python has faster prototyping and broad media scripting examples, but the app
  will quickly need robust job orchestration more than ad-hoc scripting.
- Go would produce a smaller binary and is excellent for filesystem/process work,
  but ASP.NET Core gives a richer web/backend framework, SignalR, and EF Core
  without extra assembly.
- Node would pair naturally with Svelte, but it is a weaker fit for a
  safety-critical media daemon with heavy subprocess orchestration.

### Frontend

- Svelte 5 with Vite.
- TypeScript.
- SPA build emitted as static assets.
- API client generated or typed from shared OpenAPI types later.
- Tailwind CSS is acceptable, but keep the UI dense and operational rather than
  marketing-style.

Why not SvelteKit as the primary server:

- SvelteKit with adapter-node is excellent for Node-hosted apps, but this product
  needs a long-running media worker and FFmpeg orchestration. ASP.NET Core should
  own the service process; Svelte can compile to static assets served by Kestrel.
- Svelte 5 still works fully in the UI without a separate Node server in
  production.

### Media tools

- FFmpeg for transcoding.
- ffprobe JSON output for media inspection and stream comparison.
- Optional future support for HandBrakeCLI presets, but not in MVP.

Verification should use:

- `ffprobe -v error -print_format json -show_format -show_streams`.
- Decode health check with FFmpeg using `-v error -f null -`.
- Duration tolerance checks.
- Video/audio/subtitle stream policy checks.
- Per-library VMAF for video re-encodes. New video re-encode libraries start with a Visually lossless
  target and a bounded per-title search across deterministic
  early/middle/late samples; the search falls back on missing or non-monotonic evidence and never
  bypasses final verification. Fixed quality remains available, existing libraries retain their saved
  policy, and remux/non-video paths skip VMAF. Still-image re-encodes use default-on SSIM instead.

### Container shape

Follow the familiar self-hosted media app pattern:

```yaml
services:
  optimisarr:
    image: ghcr.io/jellman86/optimisarr:dev
    container_name: optimisarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8787:8787"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - UMASK=002
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - OPTIMISARR__LOG_LEVEL=info
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/data:/data
      - /path/to/work:/work
      - /path/to/trash:/trash
```

Use `/data` as the preferred media root so users can mount one consistent path
for movies, TV, and downloads-style layouts. This follows the same operational
lesson as the Servarr/TRaSH Docker guidance: consistent paths avoid needless
copy/delete behaviour and preserve the ability to use atomic moves where the
filesystem allows it.

### Permissions

Support LinuxServer-style environment variables:

- `PUID`
- `PGID`
- `UMASK`
- `TZ`

The container should run the app as the requested UID/GID after startup. Outputs,
database files, temp files, and quarantined originals should be created with the
configured ownership and umask.

### GPU support

Supported targets:

- NVIDIA NVENC/NVDEC through Docker GPU reservations and NVIDIA Container
  Toolkit.
- Intel QSV/VAAPI through `/dev/dri` device mapping.
- AMD VAAPI through `/dev/dri` device mapping.

Compose examples should include:

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: 1
          capabilities: [gpu]
```

and:

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
```

The app should detect encoders at startup with commands such as:

- `ffmpeg -hide_banner -encoders`
- `ffmpeg -hide_banner -hwaccels`
- NVIDIA runtime presence via `nvidia-smi` when available.
- VAAPI/QSV device presence under `/dev/dri`.

Users should be able to pick:

- Auto.
- CPU x264/x265.
- NVIDIA h264/hevc/av1 when supported.
- Intel QSV h264/hevc/av1 when supported.
- VAAPI h264/hevc/av1 when supported.

New library configuration stores a portable encoder-effort intent rather than a raw backend preset.
After the exact encoder has been selected for a file, a pure policy maps Fast/Balanced/Efficient to
valid x264/x265, SVT-AV1, NVENC, or QSV syntax. VAAPI retains its driver default. Recognised
encoder-specific values from earlier releases remain explicit and preserve native behaviour until
the operator changes them. Request validation, config import/export, dispatch, and the UI share this
policy so an incompatible value fails before FFmpeg and Auto mode can safely choose different
encoder families.

#### Hardware decoding

When a hardware encoder is selected, the source is also decoded on the GPU
(`-hwaccel` + matching `-hwaccel_output_format`), keeping frames on the GPU end to
end instead of decoding in software and uploading. NVIDIA uses FFmpeg's generic CUDA/NVDEC path;
QSV and VA-API use their matching hardware surfaces. This is on by default
(`queue.hardwareDecode`) and only applies to a hardware encoder. HDR→SDR jobs use
the established software colour transform by default. The opt-in
`queue.hdrToneMapMode=Hardware` freshly confirms a non-Dolby-Vision HDR10/PQ source before it
keeps supported QSV/VA-API decode, VPP tone mapping, and encode on GPU surfaces. HLG, Dolby Vision,
unknown transfer metadata, disposable comparisons, and VMAF-gated jobs retain the software
production transform. Because source codec/profile, filter, and driver support varies, a recognised
hardware setup failure is retried once with software decode and tone mapping rather than failing
the job.

#### Live resource metrics

The Queue view shows a live CPU/GPU usage graph while a job encodes, pushed over
SignalR. All sampling is **unprivileged** so it needs no extra container capability:
CPU from `/proc/stat`; GPU from the per-process DRM fdinfo of Optimisarr's own
ffmpeg child (vendor-neutral — Intel `i915`/`xe` and AMD `amdgpu` expose
`drm-engine-*` busy counters), falling back to the AMD `gpu_busy_percent` sysfs node
or an `nvidia-smi` query. `intel_gpu_top`/the i915 perf interface is deliberately
**not** used because it requires elevation. Where no unprivileged source applies the
UI reports the GPU as unavailable.

## Safety model

### Candidate decision

A file should only enter the queue when it passes all configured gates:

- Extension/container is supported.
- File is not modified within the configured settling period.
- File is not already optimised by Optimisarr metadata.
- Expected saving exceeds threshold.
- Codec/container/quality rules say optimisation is useful.
- Library rule does not exclude path, resolution, HDR, codec, or size.
- The file is not on the exclusion list — either added manually (e.g. from a stuck
  job on the Queue) or automatically after an unrecoverable or repeated failure. A VMAF-only
  rejection gets one higher-quality retry; a remaining VMAF failure or any size-saving failure
  excludes without another encode. Other terminal failures retain the three-attempt threshold,
  while cancellations and worker interruptions do not count. Exclusions are
  durable (keyed by path) and reversible from the library's **Excluded** tab.

### Output verification

Before replacement, all required checks must pass:

- Output exists and is non-empty.
- ffprobe can parse it.
- FFmpeg full decode returns success.
- The source and output primary-picture spans are within the configured duration tolerance.
- The source picture reaches its primary-audio timeline; source corruption is reported separately
  from an output-tail failure, while subtitles, chapters, and attachments are never treated as
  programme duration.
- The output picture stream reaches the source picture stream's actual endpoint.
- Required video stream exists.
- Required audio streams are present or intentionally converted.
- Required subtitle streams are present or intentionally converted.
- Output size is below original by the configured threshold unless the rule is
  explicitly quality-normalisation rather than size-saving.

Preview jobs reuse the same verification path but never enter replacement. For
long video previews, the worker encodes a 60-second segment from the middle of
the source and the verifier creates a temporary clipped reference from that same
window before running the usual checks. The UI labels those scores as
segment-only and maps both native players onto that exact source-relative window.
The worker freshly resolves that midpoint from the primary video stream. It performs a bounded
input seek followed by an exact output seek, so re-encoded picture frames and stream-copied
audio/subtitles begin on the same requested clock without decoding the whole lead-in.
Every video path uses the measured primary-picture span, so a copied subtitle or attached picture
cannot extend the container and create a false failure. Full queue jobs still scan the complete
source and output picture timelines, and independently compare the source picture against primary
audio to catch a genuinely incomplete source without trusting ancillary-track duration.
VMAF first rebases each independently decoded source and output to its own first picture, then places
both on the source's measured frame cadence before trimming each window. Resetting the origins before
FFmpeg's cadence filter prevents differing MP4/Matroska start timestamps or timebases from padding
only one input and pairing adjacent frames at motion or scene changes.

Blind-calibration jobs are also disposable and replacement-ineligible. Video calibration encodes the
complete output contract of each library-slider preset, including codec, container, audio rules, and
its concrete configured quality. It never nests the normal Adaptive per-title VMAF search inside a
calibration scene; the exact 12-second output receives one measure-only VMAF pass after structural
verification instead.
Session creation freshly probes the selected source and places all three scenes on its primary
picture duration; the authoritative value also refreshes the inventory cache for that file.
Its reference remains a stream copy of the original compressed frames;
mid-file keyframe pre-roll is retained for correct decoding, excluded from the requested-duration
verification baseline, and exposed only as an internal playback offset so the blinded slots begin on
the same source frame. Candidate clips use the same bounded-plus-exact seek as Preview, preventing
copied streams from inheriting a different pre-roll timeline. The reference is retained until
session cleanup. Audio and image calibration
use their lossless FLAC and PNG reference paths respectively.

### Replacement

Preferred replacement sequence:

1. Create output in `/work`.
2. Move original to `/trash/<job-id>/original`.
3. Move verified output into original path.
4. Probe final path.
5. Mark job complete.

If the filesystem cannot perform atomic moves across mounts, the app must fall
back to copy plus checksum/probe verification and clearly report that the library
layout is suboptimal.
