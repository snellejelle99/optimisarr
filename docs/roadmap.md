# Optimisarr Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally implementation-focused. The goal is to build a
small, reliable core first, then widen codec, GPU, and automation support once
the replacement workflow is trustworthy.

## How to use this roadmap

- Entries are ordered by product and safety dependency, not by promised date.
- Each entry describes an outcome and the evidence needed to call it complete;
  a priority is not a release promise.
- GitHub issues hold implementation-ready scope, acceptance criteria, and
  discussion. Short-lived pull requests deliver reviewable slices into `dev`.
- Implemented user/operator behaviour moves to `CHANGELOG.md`; detailed
  engineering history belongs in
  [`engineering/history.md`](engineering/history.md).
- Code and tests remain the source of truth. Never present roadmap work as
  shipped until the repository proves it. The converse matters too: an entry left
  describing finished work as outstanding sends effort at an item that has none.
- Status claims last verified against the repository: **2026-08-24**.

## Up next (priority order, updated 2026-08-24)

1. **Phase 14 gold-standard hardening** — the next maturity pass is about making
   Optimisarr safer to expose, easier to automate, and easier to change without
   weakening the transcode → verify → replace pipeline. This phase is grounded in
   the project review at
   [`docs/reviews/2026-06-27-project-quality-and-gold-standard-review.md`](reviews/2026-06-27-project-quality-and-gold-standard-review.md)
   and its peer response. Most of the phase has shipped — admin-token auth (with
   end-to-end coverage), the self-describing CI-checked OpenAPI contract, the pipeline
   robustness pass, endpoint modularization, large-library paging, the diagnostics
   bundle, the maintained hardware validation matrix, and the roadmap/docs split are all done.
   **Real-host AMD VA-API validation** remains gated on access to suitable hardware.

   - **Adaptive language selector: done.** The sidebar language menu now measures the available
     viewport space and opens upward or downward as appropriate, with keyboard navigation and
     accessible listbox semantics retained in either direction.

   - **Per-library perceptual-quality (VMAF) gate with a quality slider: done.** VMAF can protect video
     re-encodes at selectable floors — each library offers Off, Space-saver
     (80/60), Balanced (85/70), High (90/75), Visually lossless (93/80), and Archival (96/90). It is
     enabled at Visually lossless for new video re-encode libraries, using representative clips to
     bound the cost; existing libraries keep their saved choice. Full-file, every-frame scoring can
     roughly double verification time. While off, the
     structural, duration, and size gates plus quarantine rollback still guard every replacement.
     Remux and non-video work skip the inapplicable extra decode, and existing saved choices remain
     unchanged. The long VMAF pass now reports real 0–100% progress in the queue (hero and rows), is
     named explicitly as the VMAF stage, and shows a live CPU-usage graph so the load is visible.
     Measurement is self-configuring: deterministic
     timebase/timestamp/range/pixel-format alignment, reference-size bicubic scaling, bounded
     threading, automatic HDTV/4K model selection, and like-for-like HDR→SDR reference tone-mapping.
     The report records the selected model and preparation. Unit tests own the exact production graph,
     while CI executes that graph at mismatched resolutions and separately proves the bundled 4K model
     and HDR-reference tone-map run inside the final image.

   - **Optional admin-token auth: done.** `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN`
     now gates the administrative API and SignalR hub with bearer-token authentication
     when set. The static SPA shell remains public so it can show a token prompt; useful
     API calls are blocked until the token is supplied. `/api/health`, `/api/ready`, and
     `/api/auth/status` stay open for health checks and discovery. Token comparison uses
     constant-time comparison over fixed-size token hashes, the UI stores the token
     locally and sends it on API, hub, and media-preview requests, and the deployment
     docs keep reverse-proxy authentication as the preferred public-access boundary.
     The full destructive/secret-bearing endpoint set — settings read/save/export/import,
     library create/delete/enqueue, job clear/cancel/retry/remove/replace, replacement
     rollback/approve, and the diagnostics bundle — is now covered by end-to-end tests
     that boot the real host with the token set and prove each is rejected with `401`
     without it, that the open endpoints stay reachable, and that a valid token passes.

   - **Generated, CI-checked OpenAPI contract: done.** The
     runtime OpenAPI 3.1 document is generated from the app into `docs/openapi.json`,
     and CI fails when the checked-in document drifts from the running API. The docs
     checker also verifies every path/method listed in `docs/api.md` exists in the
     generated spec. The document is now self-describing too: a titled/versioned/described
     info block, every operation grouped under an area tag (System, Settings, Libraries,
     Inventory, Queue, Replacements, Integrations, Realtime), and a documented `401` on
     every admin-token-protected operation (the three open endpoints correctly have none),
     produced by a single document transformer over a pure route→tag/protection mapping.

   - **Pipeline robustness pass: done.** The behaviour that carries product risk is now
     covered by adversarial tests, and every known live failure class is represented.
     `FfmpegCommandBuilder` stream/container permutations — attachments, data streams,
     cover art, image-based subtitles (the MP4→MKV fallback that avoids the `mov_text`
     trap), audio-only, still image, HDR tone-map, remux, and MP4/MKV — are tested.
     Replacement/reconcile state transitions are tested end to end: missing source,
     missing work output, destination occupied by a different file, concurrent replace
     callers (the job 3327 corruption), dry-run, rollback after a partial mid-move
     failure, rollback when the quarantined original is gone, and the cross-filesystem
     fallback. Candidate decisions are tested for already-optimised siblings and
     marker-tagged files, already-efficient sources, repeated failures (auto-exclude and
     optimisation history), path and HDR/resolution exclusions, and Sonarr/Radarr
     import-aware holds. The dispatcher also re-checks a queued job against the current
     rules immediately before it transcodes, so a job that became ineligible while sitting
     in a long backlog (e.g. an already-efficient source enqueued before the floor existed)
     is skipped — marked `Cancelled` with the reason — rather than wasting an encode the
     size-saving gate would only reject. The skip is a soft, reversible rule decision, not a
     blacklist entry, so the file becomes eligible again automatically if the profile changes.

   - **Cross-media pipeline standards audit: done.** The video, music, and still-image paths were
     rechecked against the repository's fail-closed replacement standard and the shipped FFmpeg
     capabilities. Music now preserves tags/artwork or refuses an unsafe container (including the
     shipped FFmpeg's demonstrated M4A attached-picture limitation), audio bitrate
     scales with retained channels, compatibility presets include compatible AAC, images guard
     animation/alpha/bit depth, expose only the shipped encoders (JPEG/WebP), and default to SSIM
     plus metadata verification, while video timing and
     encoded signal structure are evidence-checked. Probing, decode checks, and transcoding use one
     configured FFmpeg/ffprobe pair. Final-container CI now runs real representative music, JPEG,
     WebP, CFR/VFR video, frame-aligned preview VMAF, metadata, quality, stream-structure, and
     decode assertions.

   - **Endpoint modularization: done.** API routes are extracted into focused
     `src/Optimisarr.Api/Endpoints/*.cs` extension methods, including the later Setup and Calibration
     modules, leaving `Program.cs` as the composition root. The move and subsequent modules are
     protected by the generated OpenAPI document and full test suite; endpoints that need startup
     locals take them as parameters, and shared behaviours remain in endpoint helpers.

   - **Large-library API scalability.** `/api/jobs` and `/api/media` now have server-side
     filtering and pagination (`status`, `search`/`category`, date, `page`/`pageSize`, total in
     `X-Total-Count`), with a `(LibraryId, RelativePath)` index so a large inventory pages without a
     table sort. The Inventory page now drives its filter chips, counts, and pager from a combined
     `GET /api/inventory` (media paired with rule verdict, filtered/counted/paged server-side), so the
     browser fetches one page instead of every row and every candidate. The Queue table also pages
     100 rows at a time client-side so a large queue stays responsive, and the shared candidate table
     (the fleet-wide Candidates page and the per-library Candidates tab) now pages the same way, so a
     large library's candidate list renders one page at a time. Done.

   - **Diagnostics bundle and admin health details.** Shipped as `GET /api/diagnostics` (admin-only):
     version, environment, settings, per-library and integration summaries, dashboard stats, and the
     failure summary, assembled from non-secret data only (a single pure redaction step keeps provider
     tokens, API keys, and webhook URLs out; verified against real data). `/api/ready` stays small and
     orchestration-friendly. The bundle also carries tool (FFmpeg/ffprobe) and hardware-encoder
     capability and the most recent captured ffmpeg logs, so it is self-contained for a support
     ticket. Done.

   - **Hardware validation matrix: maintained; AMD evidence pending.** The public
     [matrix](setup/hardware-validation-matrix.md) records CPU, NVIDIA NVENC, Intel QSV, VA-API,
     hardware decode, VMAF, and GPU metrics by platform, with date, evidence, known limits, and a
     repeatable evidence checklist. It distinguishes "implemented and unit-tested" from "validated
     on real hardware." AMD VA-API remains the important open validation target.

   - **Roadmap/docs split: done.** The dense recently-shipped log, current status, and per-phase
     implementation detail moved to [`engineering/history.md`](engineering/history.md), so this
     roadmap answers "what is next?" while the engineering notes answer "what exactly changed and
     why?".

   - **Edge-case hardening (from upstream research).** A pass grounded in real failure modes that
     Tdarr/Unmanic/HandBrake and ffmpeg users hit, prioritised by product risk. In order:

     1. **Dolby Vision — the one safety gap: done.** The probe now flags DV distinctly (DOVI side-data
        or a `dvhe`/`dvh1`/`dav1` codec tag) and the candidate evaluator skips DV sources regardless of
        the HDR setting unless a per-library **Optimise Dolby Vision** opt-in is enabled (off by
        default, settable in the library form, preserved across config backup). This closes the gap
        where a DV Profile 5 source could be re-encoded to green/pink and still pass verification with
        VMAF off. Migration `AddDolbyVisionHandling`. (HandBrake #5597, FFmpeg HDR/DoVi notes.)
     2. **VFR → A/V-sync drift: done, corrected by audit.** The first job-3334 workaround forced every
        MP4 re-encode to CFR, which FFmpeg implements by duplicating/dropping frames. The final policy
        persists positive VFR evidence from nominal and average probe rates, applies `-fps_mode vfr`
        with the demuxer encoder timebase only to identified VFR re-encodes, and leaves CFR/unknown
        sources and all remuxes unmodified. Relative A/V-sync, timestamps, duration, and tail checks
        remain the replacement backstops. Migration `TrackVariableFrameRate`. (FFmpeg documentation.)
     3. **MP4 + MP4-incompatible audio copied → mux failure: done.** The resolver now falls back
        MP4→MKV when a source carries audio MP4 cannot mux (Dolby TrueHD, Blu-ray/DVD LPCM) and that
        audio is being copied rather than re-encoded to a compatible codec — the same pattern already
        used for image-based subtitles. (Unmanic #454.)
     4. **Robustness polish: partly done.** Done: every video job regenerates presentation timestamps
        (`-fflags +genpts`) so a source with missing/non-monotonic DTS muxes cleanly; and a hardware
        encode now drops data streams (timecode/GPMF) even for a Matroska output (Tdarr's `-dn` fix
        generalised). Deferred as speculative without hardware to reproduce against: a classified
        NVENC session-limit error (low risk — concurrency defaults to 1), and a single transient-retry
        of the encode on known-transient NVENC/QSV errors. (Tdarr #613/#729, IPCamTalk.)

   - **Open: does the whole-file measurement mis-seat its reference on an irregular source?**
     The per-title search was found on 2026-09-15 to be scoring every candidate against frames the
     encoder never saw, because its reference had `fps` applied before the window was cut: on a
     source whose frame timestamps are not perfectly regular, that filter duplicates frames and so
     moves which frames the window then holds. Measured on a real episode, a sample scored a
     harmonic mean of 6.45 where its true score was 95.52, and every search fell back to the
     library's own quality as a result. Fixed for samples by cutting the window first.

     The same ordering remains in the whole-file measurement that gates every replacement, and the
     same reasoning suggests it could mis-seat the reference there too — a full candidate is a
     regular stream while the source it is judged against may not be. It was deliberately left
     alone: it demonstrably works on real jobs (job 5915 scored 91.5 on the evidence that replaced
     it), and that ordering was chosen against a real half-frame rounding tie which the comments in
     `QualityScoreCommandBuilder` describe in detail. Needs its own investigation with the same
     method — encode a candidate, cut a lossless reference identically, and compare the graph's own
     reference branch against it — rather than a speculative change to the path that guards every
     replacement.

   - **Sampled-VMAF frame alignment: measured, not derived (2026-09-15).** Whole seasons were
     failing the quality gate with harmonic means in single figures while the encodes themselves
     were sound. Two causes, both now fixed and both recorded in full at
     [`docs/engineering/hardware-validation/2026-09-15-sampled-vmaf-frame-alignment.md`](engineering/hardware-validation/2026-09-15-sampled-vmaf-frame-alignment.md).

     FFmpeg's default frame-rate handling was dropping frames on sources ffprobe calls constant —
     about fifty an episode on a VC-1 WEBRip — which both damaged the library and made every
     windowed comparison meaningless, because frame N of the candidate stopped being frame N of the
     source. `-fps_mode passthrough` on any re-encode with no frame-rate cap now keeps them.

     Underneath that, the `distortedShift` correction was derived from the containers' headers as
     the video stream's start less the container's. Those two are equal in every real container, so
     it computed as zero for every file either sidecar had ever measured and **never once fired**.
     It could not have worked either way: two episodes of the same show, identical in every header
     field, need opposite corrections because different numbers of frames went missing in their
     encodes. All three machines now try the candidate a frame either way against a two-second
     window and keep whichever matched — the same probe and offsets on the server and both
     sidecars, so a worker and the control plane cannot disagree about the same pair of files.

     **Still open:** passthrough reduces frame loss without eliminating it — one frame lost in one
     fixture, six in another. The measurement is now honest about a candidate that lost frames; it
     does not stop them being lost.

   - **Open: a path inside a filter description is not a path.** FFmpeg unescapes a filter
     description twice on the way in — once by the filtergraph parser, again by the filter's own
     option parser — so a bare colon ends the option and a bare backslash is eaten as an escape.
     The Windows sidecar failed every quality search on this until 2026-09-15; the fix writes
     forward slashes and escapes the colon with *two* backslashes, proven against the real FFmpeg
     on the machine (of five spellings only `C\\:/path` and `'C\:/path'` produce a log).

     Two places still substitute a log path raw, and both are safe today by where the path comes
     from rather than by anything they do:

     - the macOS sidecar, whose scratch lives under `~/Library/Application Support` — safe until a
       home directory contains an apostrophe, which opens a quoted section and swallows the rest of
       the graph. Worth fixing to the same rule; it was left alone on 2026-09-15 only because the
       Swift toolchain was unusable that day and the Mac was the one sidecar working. The alignment
       probe added later that day does escape its own log path, so the remaining exposure is the
       server's measurement commands rather than anything the Mac writes itself.
     - the server itself, whose log path is always `Path.GetTempPath()/optimisarr-vmaf-<guid>.json`
       and so contains nothing that needs escaping. It would break if `TMPDIR` ever pointed
       somewhere with a colon or an apostrophe in it.

     The reference and distorted paths are `-i` arguments, not filter options, and must **not** be
     escaped — doing so would name files that do not exist.

2. **Gold-standard first-run setup wizard: complete** — turn a new, empty installation into safe,
   understandable libraries without hiding Docker-level mistakes or weakening Optimisarr's
   fail-closed defaults. This is the next independently actionable product item while the hardware
   validation matrix remains gated on access to non-Intel GPUs.

   - **Trigger, resume, and ownership: done.** A versioned `SetupState` now distinguishes
     a genuinely new database from an upgrade, persists each completed step, resumes after refresh or
     restart, accepts duplicate progress writes idempotently, and permits completion only from final
     review. Upgraded installations are marked complete and never forced into onboarding. Back retains
     applied choices, and **Settings → Backup → First-run setup** offers **Run setup again** without
     deleting configuration.
     Connections remain explicitly skipped on the final review and can be added later, so an optional
     provider can never block first use.
   - **Five stable, task-oriented steps: done.** One heading and primary action drive:
     (1) welcome, safety model, and private-network/auth exposure; (2) system readiness; (3) any
     number of libraries and their optimisation rules; (4) verification, scheduling, quarantine, and replacement
     safety; (5) review and apply. Keep integrations optional after the core path, or as a clearly
     skippable sub-step, so Plex/Jellyfin/Sonarr/Radarr availability can never block first use. A
     stable step indicator shows “step N of 5”, current/completed/pending text, `aria-current`, and
     separate Back/Continue controls—the [USWDS step-indicator guidance](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/step-indicator/)
     recommends this pattern for linear processes with three or more high-level sections.
   - **Prove the environment instead of merely collecting fields: shipped.** The readiness
     step runs the existing tool/capability checks and non-destructive probes for `/config`, `/work`,
     `/trash`, and the chosen media root: existence, effective read/write permissions, available
     space, and whether media, work, and quarantine remain below one container mount boundary for
     atomic replacement. It detects
     encoder support with the same real test encode used by Tools. Database connectivity,
     required/optional tools, detected hardware encoders, and effective read/write access for config,
     work, quarantine, and every configured library root are visible and gate progress. Each row now
     carries free/total capacity plus filesystem, mount, type, and boundary evidence; configured
     libraries state whether work and quarantine moves are atomic. Missing, unreadable, unwritable,
     and low-space states produce exact local, Compose, Unraid, and TrueNAS recovery steps. A
     loading/announced **Re-test system** action reruns the real probes and clears resolved advice.
     The container never pretends it can create a host bind mount or change host permissions. Docker
     documents that mounts must be explicitly granted to a service and recommends
     [secrets rather than environment variables for sensitive values](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/).
   - **Safe recommendations, not silent automation: done.** Start in dry-run
     mode, one concurrent job, auto-replace off, conservative free-space/quarantine settings, and no
     auto-enqueue until the user reviews them. Explain encoder-specific quality, preview one
     representative candidate when possible, and show the estimated effect before saving. The wizard
     may recommend hardware decode, a VMAF tier, and a schedule from detected capabilities, but every
     recommendation remains visible and reversible. It never scans, enqueues, transcodes, replaces,
     or deletes an original until the
     user confirms the review screen. The flow visibly applies dry-run/concurrency, creates
     every new library with auto-enqueue and auto-replace off; video re-encode libraries use the
     adaptive VMAF-first default selected in the full embedded rules editor. The wizard starts no work.
     Proved HEVC hardware support now drives a visible,
     reversible encoder/hardware-decode recommendation; the explicitly applied CPU recommendation
     selects Fixed with VMAF off, while a proved NVIDIA CUDA-VMAF path may recommend Adaptive with
     Balanced. The overnight window remains opt-in and never turns
     auto-enqueue on. A representative probed candidate can launch the established disposable preview;
     an honest empty state explains why a fresh, unscanned library has nothing to preview yet.
   - **Review before commitment: done.** The final form groups security, storage, library, encoder,
     quality, scheduling, integration, and replacement choices; each section has an accessible Change action
     that returns directly to that step with values pre-populated. GOV.UK's
     [check-answers pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/) uses this
     review to raise confidence and reduce submission errors. Applying the plan uses one validated
     database transaction, rolls back on failure, is idempotent after a lost response, returns a clear
     no-work-started receipt, and links directly to candidate review rather than starting destructive work.
   - **Accessible recovery: done.** Validate when Continue is pressed, preserve all
     user input, place a concise error summary at the top, move focus to it, and associate inline
     errors with their fields. W3C requires logical
     [keyboard focus order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html) and recommends
     concise, actionable [form notifications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/);
     WCAG 2.2 also adds minimum target size, unobscured focus, redundant-entry, and accessible-
     authentication criteria. Status from readiness tests uses a polite live region without stealing
     focus, and progress never relies on colour alone.
   - **Gold-standard acceptance matrix: automated core shipped.** API/domain tests cover state transitions,
     ordered/idempotent progress, upgrade bypass, rejected and duplicate final apply, settings persistence,
     recommendation policy, and the no-source-mutation invariant. Browser tests cover
     Back/Continue/Change/Skip/Re-test and final apply across light/dark mode,
     all nine locales, keyboard and role/name semantics, reduced motion, the 320px WCAG 400%-reflow
     equivalent, 390px mobile width, and landscape. Readiness/policy tests cover missing, unreadable,
     unwritable and low-space paths, absent VMAF, and unproved GPU encoders; authentication tests cover
     every setup mutation. Optional integrations are not contacted during setup by design. The final
     apply transaction explicitly rolls back on an exception, and applying setup leaves a sentinel
     source file byte-for-byte unchanged while preview work remains disposable under `/work`.

3. **Phase 13 release hardening: done.** Dry-run mode, config-and-secrets backups, migration
   smoke coverage, synthetic-media integration coverage, GHCR publishing, README quickstart
  hardening, troubleshooting, and security notes are all shipped, and the exit criterion is met:
  a careful user can run Optimisarr against a real library with dry-run, verification, quarantine,
  and rollback available. Every deliverable in
  [`engineering/history.md`](engineering/history.md#phase-13-release-hardening) is marked done.

   Two deliverables are deliberately narrower than their one-line names suggest, and those bounds
   are the intended scope rather than outstanding work: config backup covers portable
   config-and-secrets snapshots, leaving raw SQLite state backup external and operator-owned; and
   migration testing covers empty-database smoke. Backups intentionally omit media, jobs,
   replacements, quarantine, and rollback history. CI stays on standard GitHub-hosted public-repo
   runners and avoids paid external services.

4. **First-class diagnostics & observability API: done.** "Why did this fail?" is answerable
   from the API alone, without SSH-ing the host or reading container logs. Failed-job detail was
   already reachable when this entry opened (`GET /api/jobs` carries `ErrorMessage`,
   `FfmpegArguments`, and the verification report per job), but it was unfiltered, unaggregated,
   and lossy. Every bullet below has since shipped. Scope:
   - **Status-filtered job queries: done.** `GET /api/jobs?status=Failed` narrows server-side so
     callers don't fetch every row and filter client-side.
   - **Failure aggregation endpoint: done.** `GET /api/jobs/failures` groups failures by classified
     reason (size-saving gate, container incompatibility, image-based subtitles, replacement
     collision, source/output missing, verification, other) with counts and recent sample jobs,
     largest first. Backed by a pure, shared `FailureClassifier` so the buckets drive both the API
     and (later) the UI.
   - **Process-log capture: done.** A failed ffmpeg run keeps its substantive stderr (stream mapping,
     warnings, the ending error; progress frames filtered, long logs head/tail-elided) on the job,
     served at `GET /api/jobs/{id}/log` as plain text. The rich stderr that explains a failure is no
     longer container-log-only. Stored only on ffmpeg failure to keep the DB lean (verification
     failures are explained by their report). Migration `AddJobProcessLog`.
   - **Structured failure category on `Job`: done.** The classified reason is written to a
     `FailureCategory` column the moment a job fails, so the summary groups in the database and the
     class survives an edited message (older rows fall back to on-read classification). Surfaced per
     job on `GET /api/jobs` too. Migration `AddJobFailureCategory`.
   - **Failures UI: done.** A Failures tab on the Queue page groups failed jobs by reason (count,
     description, recent samples) with an inline "View log" drill-in to the captured ffmpeg log —
     deliberately a Queue tab, not a sidebar entry, to keep job views together and the sidebar lean.
   - **Filters and pagination: done.** `GET /api/jobs` takes `libraryId`, `category`, `since`/`until`,
     and `page`/`pageSize` (total returned in the `X-Total-Count` header; body unchanged); the failure
     summary takes a `libraryId`. SQL-translatable filters run in the database, the date filter and
     ordering in memory (SQLite can't order/compare a `DateTimeOffset`). This completes the item.
   The classification then feeds back into the dashboards and reports rather than the eligibility
   logic, which now handles the "skip before we waste an encode" cases directly — see the
   *already-optimised sibling skip* and *already-efficient source skip* notes below.

5. **Full translation parity with YA-WAMF: done.** The Optimisarr UI and
   user-facing API/status strings, then provide complete translations for the same language
   set currently carried by YA-WAMF: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese,
   Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese (`en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `ja`, `pt`, `ru`, `zh`).

   - **Foundation and completeness gate: done.** A typed locale system under `web/src/lib/i18n/`
     with English as the source of truth (`type Messages = typeof en`) and every other locale typed
     against it, so a missing or misspelled key fails `npm run check` — translation completeness is a
     compile-time CI gate, not something that can silently rot. A Svelte 5 runes store exposes the
     active locale's messages with a `t()` interpolation helper and a `plural()` helper; the choice
     is persisted to `localStorage` and falls back to the browser language, then English. A language
     selector lives in the sidebar footer.
   - **Every page migrated: done.** The app shell and navigation, plus Dashboard, Schedule,
     Quarantine, Inventory, Queue, Settings, and Libraries — including confirm dialogs, InfoTip help
     text, preset/profile/HDR label maps, empty states, and count-aware/pluralised strings. **German**
     ships complete across all of it as the first translated locale.
   - **Shared components: done.** `MediaCompare`, `FolderPicker`, `BottomSheet`,
     `FailuresPanel`, `ToolsPanel`, and `CandidateTable` now use the typed locale contract.
     `VerificationChecks` owns no prose (its names/details come from the backend), and
     `PreviewCompare` now translates its progress, errors, safety copy, comparison labels, stats,
     and verification summary too.
   - **Backend-originated UI messages and language parity: done.** JSON endpoint failures now
     carry stable machine-readable codes plus an English compatibility fallback; the web client
     resolves those codes through the same typed locale contract. This covers settings and query
     validation, filesystem/library/media/job errors, exclusions, replacements, and integrations.
     Persisted job failure categories likewise drive translated queue and diagnostics summaries,
     while raw encoder/backend output remains available only as explicitly labelled technical
     detail. **German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Simplified
     Chinese are complete** across the same 832-message typed contract. CI audits interpolation
     placeholders across all eight translations so tokens such as `{count}` and `{path}` cannot be
     dropped silently. Locale modules remain lazy-loaded, keeping every translation out of the
     initial application chunk until selected. Native-speaker refinements remain welcome through
     normal issue reports, but no language is navigation-only or structurally incomplete.

6. **Packaging, app-store templates, and discovery** — make Optimisarr easy to find and
   install where Docker media-stack users already look. Keep the Docker contract stable and
   make every template expose the same core surface: image tag, web port, admin token,
   `/config`, work/output, quarantine, media-library paths, health check, optional hardware
   acceleration, update-channel guidance, and a smoke-test checklist.

   - **Unraid Community Applications template: template shipped; discovery listing remains.**
     `unraid/optimisarr.xml` (volume mappings for config, media, work, and quarantine, the `8787`
     port, optional `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN`, PUID/PGID/UMASK, and an optional `/dev/dri` device),
     a repository-root `ca_profile.xml`, and `docs/setup/unraid.md` are shipped. Remaining: promote
     the template + profile to the default branch at release and pursue the Community Applications
     discovery listing so users don't need to paste the raw template URL.

   - **TrueNAS custom-app docs, then catalog submission.** First document the low-friction
     TrueNAS Custom App path so users can deploy the existing container before catalog
     acceptance. Then submit a community-train app to `truenas/apps` with the expected
     Docker Compose catalog files: `app.yaml`, `ix_values.yaml`, `questions.yaml`, a Jinja2
     `templates/docker-compose.yaml`, `README.md`, and `templates/test_values/basic-values.yaml`.
     The TrueNAS wizard should expose the web port, private admin token, storage mappings,
     optional GPU/device settings, CPU/memory limits, a portal link, and a health check against
     `/api/ready` or `/api/health`. Validate with the TrueNAS apps CI render/deploy workflow
     before opening the PR, and open a draft PR early to catch catalog-review issues.

   - **Container registry discoverability.** Continue publishing GHCR images and add Docker Hub
     publishing once release tags are stable, with matching descriptions, labels, README text,
     supported architectures, and examples. Keep image names, environment variables, health
     checks, and permissions in sync across docs and templates.

   - **Additional self-hosting templates.** Add a Portainer app-template/stack example and
     evaluate CasaOS/ZimaOS packaging after the Unraid and TrueNAS paths settle. Consider YunoHost
     only if the install and upgrade model can be made appliance-like enough to avoid fragile
     maintenance.

   - **Project directories and community launch points.** Submit or announce Optimisarr in the
     places media-stack and self-hosting users already discover tools: Awesome Selfhosted,
     selfh.st/apps, AlternativeTo, the Unraid and TrueNAS forums, and relevant communities such
     as r/selfhosted, r/unRAID, r/truenas, r/radarr, and r/sonarr. Prioritise a short, honest
     positioning statement, screenshots, quickstart links, and clear safety guarantees over
     generic promotion.

7. **Blind quality calibration ("placebo panel"): video, audio, and image slices done** — help a user choose
   the most space-efficient quality that they cannot reliably distinguish from their own source,
   without revealing the setting or estimated saving early. The design is informed by the source,
   observer, presentation, repetition, and paired-comparison principles in
   [ITU-R BT.500](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.500-15-202305-I/en) and
   [ITU-T P.910](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.910-202310-I/en); it is a personal calibration aid,
   not a standards-conformant laboratory study or a claim of perceptual equivalence.

   - **Shipped for SDR video.** A saved video library can use one chosen, probed source. Optimisarr
     prepares 12-second early, middle, and late clips for the four complete library-slider presets,
     presents the original as a fixed reference beside four shuffled anonymous candidates, and
     asks the user to classify each candidate once as Indistinguishable, Acceptable, or Visibly worse. The most
     compressed acceptable candidate is recommended; if none is acceptable, the current setting is kept.
   - **Bias and interaction controls are shipped.** The setting, encoder and saving remain hidden
     until every candidate classification is complete. The original is marked so every judgement has
     a stable baseline; candidate quality labels remain blind. The reference and lettered candidates share
     one large viewport and relative playback position, support mouse, keyboard, and touch controls,
     and native playback fails closed if any sample cannot be decoded. Video supports browser
     fullscreen for close inspection. Applying
     the recommendation is a separate, explicit action and is refused if the library's relevant
     settings changed during the session.
   - **Long-GOP reference alignment is shipped.** Video candidates retain each preset's complete
     output contract while their original-side references remain a bit-for-bit stream
     copy, including the preceding keyframe packets required to decode a mid-file scene; Optimisarr
     records that hidden pre-roll, verifies the intended 12-second window, and starts playback at
     the matching frame. References live for the session and are removed with its other disposable
     work. A shared accessible 0–12-second control hides raw container duration from the observer.
     This prevents false Duration/Tail failures without weakening either gate, revealing the
     original, or introducing a second-generation reference encode.
   - **HDR video is shipped with a fail-closed presentation contract.** Non-Dolby-Vision HDR is
     offered only when the library preserves HDR, the browser reports an HDR-capable display path,
     and the user confirms the intended display is presenting HDR. This follows the signal and
     viewing-condition principles in [ITU-R BT.2100](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.2100) and uses
     the W3C `video-dynamic-range`/`dynamic-range` capability signal. It does not silently tone-map
     or claim a laboratory-grade HDR result. Dolby Vision remains excluded because its RPU dynamic
     metadata cannot safely survive Optimisarr's current re-encode path.
   - **Level-matched audio is shipped.** Music and mixed libraries can test Opus, AAC, or MP3
     bitrate ladders using three repeatable 15-second excerpts. Each original-side excerpt is a
     lossless FLAC derivative; the full lineup is measured with EBU R128 integrated loudness and
     every version is attenuated to the quietest one in the browser, preserving files and avoiding
     clipping. Instant reference/A–E switching keeps relative playback position. This follows the
     hidden-reference and controlled-listening principles in
     [ITU-R BS.1116](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1116-3-201502-I/en) and the measurement method
     in [EBU Tech 3341](https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3341).
   - **Synchronized image comparison is shipped.** Photo and mixed libraries can test five output
     quality levels against a lossless PNG derivative in one shared viewport. Reference/A–E switching keeps
     zoom and pan identical, all streams preload and fail closed, and animated images are excluded.
     This follows the observer-controlled comparison principles in
     [ISO 20462-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/38330.html) without claiming laboratory compliance.
   - **Cheap and safe by construction is shipped.** Candidates are disposable jobs isolated under
     `/work/calibration`; they bypass normal candidate scheduling but still receive structural
     verification. Video candidates use each preset's concrete quality and one measure-only VMAF
     pass per completed scene rather than recursively running the library's adaptive per-title
     search inside every comparison clip. They cannot replace, move, or delete a source and are
     hidden from the normal queue. Every saved Film, TV, Music, Photo, and mixed library exposes the
     compatible personal check from its own configuration page. Leaving the full-page lab or
     restarting Optimisarr removes the session's database rows and scratch files. The original is
     only read.
   - **Next research and implementation.** Select representative sources using spatial/temporal
     complexity rather than file size alone and support a small multi-source result; correlate the
     revealed choice with sampled VMAF without turning the metric into a hint. Extend toward a
     multi-source result only after each media kind remains separately validated rather than
     stretching one perception method across unlike tasks.

8. **VMAF performance on modest hardware: done.** VMAF is the slow part of verification, and on a
   low-power host (e.g. an Intel N100) a full-file measurement is effectively unusable. Representative
   clip scoring made the adaptive VMAF-first path practical as the default for new video re-encode libraries.

   - **The honest hardware picture: done.** The only GPU acceleration for the VMAF computation itself is
     **VMAF-CUDA** (`libvmaf_cuda`, part of VMAF 3.0 / FFmpeg 6.1) — **NVIDIA only**. There is no
     Intel (QSV/VAAPI), AMD, Vulkan, OpenCL, or NPU/OpenVINO backend for the VMAF feature
     extractors; Intel/AMD silicon can hardware-accelerate decode and scaling but not the scoring.
     Document this plainly so users don't expect QSV/VAAPI/NPU VMAF that does not exist.
   - **Optional CUDA VMAF when an NVIDIA GPU is present: done.** Detect the filter and switch to NVDEC
     decode + `scale_cuda` + `libvmaf_cuda` (CUDA frames end to end), falling back to the CPU path
     otherwise. Reported ~4.4× throughput. Needs an ffmpeg built with `--enable-nonfree`
     `--enable-libvmaf` and `--enable-ffnvcodec` (and the CUDA VMAF library), so it is a build/runtime capability check,
     not an assumption.
   - **CPU-side wins for everyone else (the N100 case): done.** In impact order: score a short
     representative **clip** instead of the whole file (reuse the preview-clip mechanism — the
     biggest single win); optionally **hardware-decode the two inputs** with QSV/VAAPI to offload
     decode while VMAF stays on the CPU; expose an `n_subsample` setting (less scoring work by measuring every
     Nth frame, with the caveat that it can step over a bad frame the catastrophic floor exists to
     catch). The incidental PSNR/SSIM video measurements were dropped when only the VMAF gate decision
     is needed. All accelerated paths fall back to software, HDR stays on its established
     software colour pipeline, and `n_threads` remains bounded to the core count.

9. **Optional Windows and macOS sidecars for distributed transcoding: implemented as an opt-in
   preview behind `OPTIMISARR_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_WORKERS`.**

   **Current status, 2026-09-17:** both platforms run the Compact Monitor UI, worker-side adaptive
   quality search and VMAF, and protocol-2 full verification without server media-tool
   fallback. Windows has an MSI-installed service/tray client with tested same-version preview
   upgrades; Mac has an anchored native popover and packaged media tools. Both use the Precession
   application icon. Real hardware and container acceptance results are recorded under
   [hardware validation](setup/hardware-validation-matrix.md), including deliberate rejection and
   rollback checks. Windows packages remain unsigned development previews; distribution/signing
   and any release-specific acceptance requirements must be checked against the platform guides.
   The detailed dated milestones below explain how the feature developed; they are not a list
   of capabilities still missing. For current installation and settings, use the
   [remote worker guide](setup/remote-workers.md).

   Keep one Optimisarr container as the control plane and safety authority, while trusted desktop sidecars
   contribute otherwise-idle CPU/GPU capacity. A sidecar may receive a read-only source, transcode
   it, run the assigned VMAF policy, and return the candidate plus evidence; it can never replace,
   quarantine, move, or delete an original. This remains post-MVP and opt-in: one container must
   continue to be the complete, uncomplicated default. **That opt-in now exists:** the
   `workers.remoteEnabled` setting is off by default and off on upgrade, no Workers tab is shown
   while it is off, and every route that pairs a machine or accepts a check-in refuses with `403`
   so the switch is a real boundary rather than a UI preference. Turning it off is non-destructive:
   check-ins stop at once, but paired records survive so an operator can still see and revoke them,
   and re-enabling restores them without a re-pair.

   - **Versioned worker protocol and explicit ownership: started.** Define a platform-neutral
     contract before either app: registration, capability discovery, heartbeats, leases, progress,
     cancellation, source/output hashes, the fully resolved encode and verification policy,
     structured FFmpeg evidence, and result acknowledgement. The main app owns job state,
     scheduling, rules, and every destructive transition. Protocol versions and worker capabilities
     must be negotiated so an upgrade cannot silently schedule a job onto an incompatible sidecar.
     **Landed so far:** version negotiation and capability matching as pure `Optimisarr.Core.Workers`
     logic — the control plane owns the contract and a newer sidecar falls back to what this build
     speaks, non-overlapping ranges are refused with a reason, and an assignment is offered only
     when the encoder, hardware decoder, VMAF mode, scratch space, and concurrency all clear, with
     every unmet requirement named. Registration, heartbeats, leases, progress, cancellation,
     hashes, the resolved-policy payload, evidence, and acknowledgement are now wired through the
     HTTP API, persistence, queue, and macOS sidecar work loop.
   - **Secure pairing and revocation: started.** Register a sidecar through a short-lived,
     single-use code displayed by the main app, then issue it a unique revocable credential. Bind
     every assignment and result to the registered worker and job lease; redact credentials from
     diagnostics and logs. Document TLS expectations, certificate trust, credential rotation, and
     the difference between a private LAN and an authenticated secure connection rather than
     treating LAN access as authentication.
     **Landed so far:** the pairing PIN and credential primitives as pure
     `Optimisarr.Core.Workers` logic. The operator reads an eight-digit PIN from Optimisarr and
     types it into the sidecar with this server's URL; the PIN lives five minutes, redeems once,
     and is destroyed after five wrong guesses rather than throttled, so a typed-length code stays
     safe on its attempt budget rather than its length. Credentials are stored only as SHA-256
     fingerprints and compared in constant time, which makes revocation total — discarding the
     fingerprint ends the worker's access. A sidecar can now actually pair: `POST
     /api/workers/pair` redeems a PIN, negotiates the protocol, records the worker, and returns its
     credential once, with issue/read/withdraw, list, and revoke routes alongside it and a `Workers`
     table behind migration `AddWorkers`. That pair route is the single worker endpoint outside the
     admin token, because a pairing sidecar holds only the PIN — it is inert unless an operator has
     just issued a code, and yields nothing without the correct one. The active PIN is held in
     memory and never persisted, so it stays out of the database and its backups. Settings has a
     Workers tab that issues a PIN, shows it grouped alongside the server address with a live
     countdown and remaining attempts, lists paired workers, and revokes them — a tab rather than a
     sidebar entry, following the same reasoning that kept Tools and Failures out of the sidebar.
     A paired worker now authenticates: `POST /api/workers/heartbeat` resolves the sidecar from its
     bearer credential, stamps the last-seen time from the control plane's own clock, and records
     the volatile numbers it reports (free scratch, current concurrency). A revoked worker fails
     there because its stored fingerprint is gone, so revocation needs no separate check and cannot
     be forgotten at a call site. Reachability uses one rule shared by the API and UI — a 30-second
     interval against a 2-minute threshold, deliberately different so one dropped beat cannot flap
     the status — and the Workers tab shows Online, Offline, Drained, or Revoked.
     Assignments, source access, evidence, and results are now bound to the credential and lease.
     **Still to build:** credential rotation and the TLS/LAN guidance.
   - **Efficient, integrity-checked media delivery: started.** Support resumable, bounded, checksummed
     streaming when the sidecar cannot see the library. Also offer an explicit shared-storage path
     mapping for SMB/NFS-mounted media so multi-gigabyte sources need not cross the network twice.
     Shared sources remain read-only; sidecar scratch stays isolated. The main app verifies source
     identity before dispatch and rejects an output, report, or resumed transfer whose hashes,
     lease, size, or policy no longer match.
     **Landed so far:** `GET /api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/source` streams an assigned original with
     `Range` support so a dropped transfer resumes, and returns the source SHA-256 so the worker can
     verify what it received. The route takes no path, filename, or library parameter — a worker
     presents a lease and the server resolves the file — so a paired sidecar cannot be induced to
     read anything other than the original already assigned to it. The source is opened shared and
     read-only, and access ends when the lease stops being held. The hash is computed once and kept
     on the job, which is what will later bind a returned candidate to the exact bytes encoded.
     `POST /api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/result` takes the candidate back, streamed and hashed as it
     arrives under a temporary name so a dead transfer never leaves something resembling a finished
     file. It is refused unless the worker still holds the lease, the declared source hash matches
     the one recorded when the source was fetched, and the upload matches the hash the worker
     declared — which together cover the late result, the duplicate delivery, the candidate encoded
     from the wrong original, and the truncated upload. An accepted candidate lands in the work
     directory a local transcode would have used and the job moves to `AwaitingVerification`, never to
     `ReadyToReplace`.
     **Landed on the evidence side:** `RemoteQualityEvidenceValidator` defines what makes a remote
     VMAF measurement admissible, failing closed on every path. Evidence is refused unless it names
     the exact source and candidate hashes, names the VMAF model — an unlabelled score cannot be
     compared to a threshold, since the same file scores differently under the HD and 4K models —
     and was measured against thresholds at least as strict as the library requires. Stricter is
     accepted: passing a harder test than the one set still passes the one set. Absent evidence is
     refused rather than read as "nothing objected".
     Resumable upload, worker-side evidence, and the local verification pass have since landed.
     Source downloads now resume in validated 64 MB ranges too, with a final whole-file hash before
     encoding. **Still to build:** the shared-storage path mapping for workers that can already see
     the library.
   - **Capability-aware leases and recovery: started.** Schedule only when OS, architecture, FFmpeg
     build, encoder, decoder, VMAF mode, free scratch space, and configured concurrency satisfy the
     job. Persist idempotent leases with expiry and heartbeats, expose drain/disable controls, and
     make retry after disconnect or restart safe. A lost, duplicated, late, cancelled, or partially
     uploaded result must never become replaceable.
     **Landed so far:** the lease state machine as pure `Optimisarr.Core.Workers` logic. A lease is
     one worker's exclusive claim on one job, and its duration is *derived* from the offline
     threshold rather than set independently, so a job can only ever be reclaimed after its holder
     has already been declared unreachable — never while it still counts as online, which is the
     case that would put two encoders on one original. Expiry is computed when the lease is read
     rather than stored, so correctness never depends on a sweeper having run and a control plane
     restarting after downtime cannot wake up believing a dead worker still holds a job. Renewing
     or completing a lapsed lease is refused, which is what makes a late result from a vanished
     worker unusable; release is idempotent so a worker retrying after a dropped response is not
     punished; and no worker can touch a lease it does not hold. Leases are now persisted and work is
     dispatched against them: `POST /api/workers/claim` offers one job at a time, only where the
     worker's proved capabilities satisfy it, and a claimed job moves from `Queued` to `Leased` so
     the local dispatcher — which selects on `Queued` — stops seeing it. That exclusion is
     structural rather than a check a future query could forget. A unique filtered index over held
     leases means two holders is a database error rather than a possible outcome. Lapsed leases are
     reclaimed whenever a worker asks for work, so recovery needs no background sweeper.

     **Corrected 2026-09-01: no job can currently be offered to a worker, so nothing is dispatched
     in practice.** The claim route names the required encoder from `Job.VideoEncoder`, which is
     written once during *local* dispatch to record what actually ran. A job sitting in the queue —
     the only state this route selects — has none, and the matcher correctly refuses an unnamed
     encoder as a malformed assignment rather than treating it as a wildcard. Every claim therefore
     falls through to `204`. The endpoint tests did not catch this because each hand-sets
     `VideoEncoder` on a queued job, a state the application never produces; a test now pins the
     real shape. The deeper reason is the same one the next bullet describes: the assignment carries
     no resolved encode policy, so there is nothing to name an encoder *for this worker* from.

     **Corrected 2026-09-04:** the assignment now carries a resolved encode contract and a claim
     can succeed; the same test asserts an executable command is returned. The verification pass
     for a returned candidate landed the same day. **Landed 2026-09-10: per-library placement.**
     A video library's Advanced options say where its work may run — *Here or on a worker*, *Only
     on this server*, *Prefer a worker* (held for an online, non-draining worker for up to ten
     minutes), or *Only on workers* — as one filter over the shared queue that the local dispatcher
     and a worker's claim both read from `WorkPlacementPolicy`, so a job keeps its priority and
     age wherever it is allowed to run. While remote workers are off every placement runs on the
     server, which is what keeps a library from stalling on a feature not in use. **Landed the same
     day: drain controls on the server.** `POST`/`DELETE /api/workers/{id}/drain` is a claim
     refusal and nothing more — held leases renew and deliver, the heartbeat answers `draining`,
     and a draining worker no longer counts as one a *Prefer a worker* library could wait for.
     **And the Workers tab now shows it:** one card per sidecar with status (Online, Draining,
     Drained, Offline, Revoked), proved capabilities, the jobs it holds with a stage and progress
     bar, load and scratch, last seen, last problem, and the Drain / Resume / Revoke controls.
     Progress reaches the server through lease renewals, which carry the stage and ffmpeg's
     encoded seconds at least every fifteen seconds; "last problem" is written by the server where
     it refuses or discards something the worker did. **And the queue says where a remote job is:**
     "encoding on Mac Studio…" with the worker's progress, "returned from … · waiting to be
     verified", and "waiting for a worker…" for a queued job its library keeps off this server.
     **Worker-side VMAF landed the same day:** the assignment carries the server's own libvmaf
     command per window with path placeholders, the sidecar runs them and posts the raw logs with
     both hashes, and the server parses, pools and judges them with `RemoteQualityEvidenceValidator`
     at verification — accepted only when bound to the delivered hash and a policy at least as
     strict as now required, otherwise measured again here with the reason on the worker's card.
     **Sidecar lifecycle, same day:** an activity assertion while a job runs (no App Nap, no
     idle sleep), the job handed back before the Mac sleeps or the app quits, check-ins resumed on
     wake, and a Start-at-login toggle via `SMAppService`. **Hardware decode on the worker:** a
     proved VideoToolbox decoder is used for VideoToolbox encodes with frames left in system
     memory, recorded on the lease, and a corrupt result requeues the job for software decode
     (`Job.PreferSoftwareDecode`). **Resumable upload:** chunked delivery at server-confirmed
     offsets with a completion carrying both hashes; the sidecar resumes from the server's offset
     after a dropped chunk. **Several jobs at once** on the sidecar (operator-chosen, one to four),
     and a probe on every launch, which fixed a relaunched sidecar reporting itself drained.
     **Still to build:** an "on a worker"
     placement for adaptive libraries once selection can hand the final encode over.
   - **The next four pieces, in dependency order (recorded 2026-09-01).** Everything below waits on
     the first, and the first two are server work of similar size to a normal feature slice.

     1. **A resolved encode policy in the assignment: landed 2026-09-04.** Before it, `AssignmentDto` carried
        `LeaseId, JobId, SourcePath, SourceBytes, VideoEncoder, Vmaf, ExpiresUtc,
        RenewWithinSeconds` — no quality, container, encoder effort, audio codec or bitrate, HDR
        treatment, track removals, encoder tuning, or VMAF thresholds. A worker holding one cannot
        know what to encode. This slice must also resolve the encoder *for the worker* from its
        proved capabilities (which is what makes a claim possible at all — see the correction
        above), and stop sending `job.MediaFile.Path`, since the source route deliberately takes no
        path.

        **Open design decision.** Either send a declarative policy and let the sidecar build its own
        FFmpeg arguments — which duplicates `FfmpegCommandBuilder`'s ~589 lines of container,
        subtitle, VFR and tone-map subtleties in Swift, and invites drift — or send the argument
        array the server already builds for that encoder, with placeholders for input and output,
        and have the worker validate it against an allowlist before substituting. The second keeps
        one tested source of truth for the encode contract and suits a design where the *output* is
        judged rather than the command; it needs care that a compromised or buggy server cannot
        direct a worker's FFmpeg at anything but its own scratch paths. **Decided 2026-09-04: the
        argument array.** The worker validates it against an allowlist and substitutes only its
        own scratch paths.

        **Landed:** `QueueDispatcher.PrepareRemoteWorkAsync` runs the dispatcher's own preparation
        with the encoder chosen from the worker's proved list (`WorkerEncoderCatalogue` feeding
        `EncoderSelector` in Auto order), software decode, no thread limit, and `{{input}}` /
        `{{output}}.<ext>` placeholders (`WorkerProtocol`). The assignment carries the argument
        array, the output extension, and the VMAF requirement (measure, model, subsample, clip,
        thresholds); it no longer carries a server path. Refused with a logged reason: remux, audio
        and image jobs, and adaptive-VMAF libraries whose per-title quality has not been chosen,
        since selection runs on this machine's encoder and does not transfer. The VideoToolbox
        family is now known to the selector, the quality, preset and tuning policies, and the
        command builder (`-q:v` on a linear map from the CRF scale; **real-hardware calibration of
        that line is still owed**). Hardware decode, the VMAF command, and worker-side allowlist
        validation have since landed. Adaptive selection on the worker remains.

     2. **A verification pass for a delivered candidate: landed 2026-09-04.** Before it,
        `POST /api/workers/leases/{id}/result`
        accepted an upload, bound it to the lease and source hash, and set the job to `Verifying`
        — where nothing picks it up. `QueueDispatcher` only ever selects `Queued`. Worse, the
        startup recovery sweep treats any `Verifying` job as interrupted, deletes its work output
        and requeues it, so a returned candidate is silently discarded at the next restart. That is
        an acceptable interim only because nothing can be delivered today; it becomes a race that
        destroys a finished encode the moment a drainer exists, so both must land together.

        `VerifyAndFinishAsync` reads only eight of `JobWork`'s twenty-four fields — `Spec`,
        `Original`, `VerificationPolicy`, `VideoEncoder`, `VideoQuality`, `IsCalibration`,
        `IsDisposable`, `UsedHardwareDecode` — and none is a local-transcode artefact, so extracting
        a verification input that both paths build is tractable. `RemoteQualityEvidenceValidator`
        (already merged, still unwired) judges the returned VMAF evidence.

        **Open design decision.** A delivered-and-waiting job is currently indistinguishable from
        one mid-verification locally. Either add a `JobStatus` such as `AwaitingVerification` —
        honest, visible to operators, correct recovery semantics, but a migration, nine locales, UI
        states, and a wider enum that sidecars observe — or a nullable marker on `Job`, which is one
        column and no translation surface but hides the distinction. **Decided 2026-09-04: the
        status.** The recovery sweep's mistake is a state-semantics one, and a hidden marker would
        paper over exactly the distinction it gets wrong.

        **Landed:** `JobStatus.AwaitingVerification` (string-converted column, so no migration).
        Delivery sets it; `DispatchAsync` drains it ahead of new encodes under the same cap and
        activity policy; `VerifyDeliveredAsync` rebuilds the contract for the delivering worker
        (`LoadWorkAsync` with the remote placement) and hands the candidate to the same
        `VerifyAndFinishAsync` a local encode uses, so replacement, auto-replace, VMAF retry and
        failure handling are shared. Restart recovery (`RecoveryActionFor`) keeps a delivered
        candidate found mid-verification, recognised by its `remote-<job>` name (`RemoteCandidate`),
        and requeues local work as before. Enqueue de-duplication, timed cleanup, stats, queue
        clearing, cancel and the queue page all know the two remote statuses. A result for a job
        that is no longer `Leased` (cancelled, say) is refused. Worker-side VMAF evidence has since
        landed and is accepted only when its hashes and policy satisfy `RemoteQualityEvidenceValidator`;
        otherwise the server measures locally.

     3. **The sidecar's work loop: landed 2026-09-04.** Claim, renew, release, source download
        with a hash check, transcode with progress, and result upload are implemented
        (`SidecarClient`, `JobRunner`, `AssignmentCommand`), and `SidecarSession` claims one job
        per healthy check-in while idle. The command contract on the worker side is an explicit
        allowlist of the options the server's builder emits, the two placeholder tokens as the only
        input and output, and no path-like value; a refused command hands the job back naming the
        token. Losing the lease cancels the encode; forgetting the pairing cancels the job; scratch
        is removed on every exit path. Worker-side VMAF and resumable uploads landed on 2026-09-10.
        On 2026-09-12 source downloads also became resumable in validated 64 MB ranges, and the
        runner gained a fail-closed free-space recheck immediately before fetching a claimed source.

        **Real-hardware evidence (2026-09-04, Apple Silicon Mac, local server built from dev):**
        `LiveWorkLoopTests` paired with proved capabilities, claimed a queued 1080p60 H.264 job,
        received `hevc_videotoolbox` with the 30 fps cap applied, encoded with the bundled ffmpeg,
        and delivered; the server verified the candidate through every gate including VMAF
        (harmonic mean 97.74 against a floor of 93) and marked it ready to replace. The VMAF
        retry also crossed the boundary: a first candidate failed the gate, was requeued at
        higher quality, claimed again and delivered again. The run found four defects, all fixed
        in the same change: Kestrel's 30 MB body cap refused the candidate; the delivering worker
        was looked up by ordering a `DateTimeOffset` in SQLite; the candidate was named after the
        source's extension rather than the contract's container (the replacement takes the final
        extension from that name); and the frame-rate cap's `fps` filter and the verification's
        reference preparation kept different frames on an exact 2:1, scoring 48 for a 97 encode —
        both sides now thin by frame index. The worker-side allowlist also refused the new filter
        for its escaped comma until taught to tell an escape from a Windows path, which is the
        fail-closed behaviour it exists for.

     4. **Productionisation.** Drain controls, launch-at-login, sleep/wake, App Nap,
        cancel-on-quit, and a pre-transfer low-disk refusal have landed. Developer ID signing,
        notarisation, update packaging, and the full release-build acceptance run remain; neither
        platform is described as supported until there is real-hardware acceptance evidence.

   - **Preserve the verification boundary: implemented in both modes.** New installations default to
     strict verification, which delegates media measurements to a protocol-2 worker; the server
     validates the contract and hashes and evaluates every required gate from complete evidence.
     Missing or inconsistent strict evidence fails without local media-tool fallback. Replacement
     authority always stays on the server. Existing installations retain their verification choice;
     the opt-out mode repeats structural/decode checks on the server and uses remote VMAF only for
     matching bytes and policy. See the [strict verification review](engineering/hardware-validation/2026-09-17-strict-sidecar-verification.md).
     This default does not turn on remote workers or change per-library placement. When an operator
     does enable them, requiring a complete, hash-bound worker report keeps the container from
     silently taking over media verification and makes missing evidence a visible failure.
   - **Windows sidecar application.** Ship a self-contained background service with a small tray UI
     for pairing, availability, concurrency, current work, logs, updates, and removal. Package and
     test unattended startup, clean upgrades, cancellation, sleep/resume, low-disk handling, CPU
     encoding, and only the hardware encoders/decoders proved available on that machine. NVIDIA
     CUDA VMAF may be advertised when the bundled tools prove it; CPU VMAF remains the portable
     fallback.
   - **macOS sidecar application: started.** Ship a signed and notarized service with a minimal menu-bar UI
     and durable launch-at-login/background-service behaviour. Support Apple Silicon first, probe
     rather than assume VideoToolbox capabilities, and use CPU VMAF because Apple GPUs have no VMAF
     compute backend. Test sleep/wake, App Nap, low-disk handling, upgrades, cancellation, and
     permission prompts without requiring broad access to the user's filesystem.
     **Landed so far:** `sidecars/macos`, a Swift package (not an `.xcodeproj`, so the build is
     reviewable as text) building a menu-bar app that pairs by URL and PIN, keeps its
     credential in the Keychain, and checks in on the interval the server states. It now bundles an
     ffmpeg built from pinned source and reports what this Mac proves it can do — each VideoToolbox
     encoder confirmed by a real throwaway encode, hardware decode by an encode-then-decode round
     trip — because every Apple build lists VideoToolbox whether or not a machine can open it. A Mac
     that proves nothing still reports nothing, and the fail-closed matcher never offers it work. Revocation, an incompatible protocol,
     and the feature being switched off server-side are each surfaced distinctly rather than as a
     generic failure. A live test suite runs the real client against a running server, which is how
     this contract gets a second implementation holding it honest. It now claims work, fetches the
     source by lease in resumable ranges, validates and runs the server's command with the bundled
     ffmpeg, keeps the lease renewed, measures VMAF, and delivers the candidate with both hashes in
     resumable chunks (see piece 3 above), and has
     done so end to end on real Apple Silicon hardware against a server built from `dev`, with the
     candidate passing every server gate including VMAF. Launch-at-login, sleep/wake, App Nap,
     drain controls, concurrent jobs, and a pre-transfer low-disk refusal have landed too.
     Every long-running stage renews the lease and cancels its transfer or process if the lease
     is lost. Packaging and native UI have since landed; the current Mac uses `NSStatusItem` and an
     anchored `NSPopover`, including resize regression tests. Consult the current platform release
     guides for signing/notarisation status rather than treating historical development builds as
     certified releases.
   - **Operational UI and acceptance evidence.** The main app shows each worker's trustworthy name,
     platform, version, capabilities, health, load, active lease, transfer progress, and last error;
     worker removal immediately prevents new assignments. Automated contract and end-to-end tests
     cover tampered data, stale credentials, incompatible versions, duplicate delivery, network
     interruption, main/worker restarts, cancellation, and a sentinel source remaining byte-for-byte
     unchanged. Real Windows and macOS hardware evidence is required before either platform is
     described as supported.

10. **Adaptive per-title VMAF quality targeting: validate the experimental implementation.** The
    implementation of Mike's issue #26 workflow now runs a bounded set of short
    representative encodes at different encoder-specific quality values, measures them with the
    library's VMAF policy, and selects the smallest actually encoded passing candidate. This
    complements the personal blind-quality check: one calibrates the person's library-level
    preference, while this feature adapts that chosen target to the complexity of an individual
    title.

    - **Default for new video re-encode libraries, with an honest cost.** Existing libraries retain
      their saved path and Fixed remains available. The per-library radio path states the upper bound
      of four qualities across three 40-second scenes and the Queue uses its
      probing stage during preparation. Cancellation follows the normal active-job control.
    - **Defaulting an Experimental path on is a deliberate, recorded exception.** It is the one
      accepted departure from "defaults should be conservative" below and from the same rule in
      [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §1, taken with the prototype-acceptance evidence below still
      outstanding on every encoder family. The reasoning: the safety model is unchanged, because the
      search falls back to the fixed quality whenever evidence is missing or non-monotonic, and the
      finished output still clears every structural, decode, duration, tail, stream, size, and
      configured VMAF gate before any replacement. What is unproven is cost and predictability —
      probing time and the stability of the selected quality — not whether an original can be lost.
      The blast radius is bounded to newly created libraries, existing saved choices are untouched,
      and Fixed stays one selection away. Defaulting it on is also what produces the real-world
      evidence this entry needs; left opt-in, too few libraries would exercise it for the acceptance
      comparison to ever arrive. The Experimental label stays until that evidence does, so the
      default is an evidence-gathering decision rather than a claim the path is proved.
    - **Representative evidence, not a favourable frame search.** Reuse deterministic early, middle,
      and late windows selected before any scores are known. Apply the complete picture contract
      (codec, bit depth, resolution, HDR treatment, encoder effort, and relevant filters) to every
      video-only probe so a cheap surrogate encode cannot select a value the real job does not
      reproduce and unrelated copied tracks cannot distort the size comparison.
    - **Bounded search that does not assume perfect monotonicity or output size.** Use
      encoder-family-specific safe bounds and at most a small fixed number of probes. Bracket the
      gate, retain every measured candidate's encoded video bytes and VMAF result, and fail back to
      the library setting when noisy hardware scores, unsupported values, or a non-monotonic result
      make the choice ambiguous. Never loop until a preferred answer appears.
    - **Do not share a decision.** The prototype deliberately does not cache across work. Its
      selected raw value is bound to the job only so recovery retries remain anchored to it; another
      title always gathers its own evidence.
    - **The final output still has to prove itself.** A sampled search chooses a candidate setting;
      it never authorises replacement. The resulting full encode still runs the structural, decode,
      duration, tail, stream, size, and configured final VMAF gates. The existing single
      higher-quality retry and fail-closed exclusion remain the backstop if the prediction does not
      hold for the complete title.
    - **Prototype acceptance.** Compare total work, selected quality, size, VMAF, and repeatability
      against the fixed-setting path across CPU, QSV, NVENC, and VA-API evidence where hardware is
      available. Promote it from experimental only if the bounded search saves meaningful space or avoids failures without
      creating surprising encode time, unstable choices, or weaker verification.

11. **Tell an operator a newer version exists, without telling anyone anything.** Optimisarr has no
    way to say "there is a newer release" or "this sidecar is older than the server it is paired
    to". The first is why a fix can sit unnoticed for weeks; the second is why a Mac ran a build two
    commits behind a fix it needed and nothing on the page could have said so. YA-WAMF already
    solves the release half, and its design is worth reusing — but its privacy posture is not, and
    the difference matters more here than the mechanism does.

    - **What YA-WAMF does, and which parts to take.** `backend/app/utils/version.py` keeps the
      comparison pure and free of I/O, so "is a newer release available?" is deterministic and
      unit-testable without a network; it compares only the numeric release core, so a dev build of
      the same version is not an update, a dev build ahead of stable does not nag, and an
      unparseable version never reports one. `backend/app/version.py` composes `base-branch+hash`
      from a `VERSION` file, the branch, and the git hash, omitting the branch for release
      channels. `backend/app/services/update_service.py` is channel-aware — a branch install
      compares commit hashes against its own branch, a release install compares semver against
      stable — and wraps the fetch in a single-flight lock with a fifteen-minute success cache and a
      five-minute failure retry, never blocking a request and degrading to the last known good
      answer or to "no update". It is a notification only: YA-WAMF never updates itself, and
      pulling a new image stays the orchestrator's job. Take all of that.

    - **Default off.** Running Optimisarr is not itself a thing anyone need be coy about — it
      optimises media, and that is all it says about anyone. The reason to default the check off is
      narrower and better: it is a network request the operator did not ask for, on a machine whose
      whole job is to sit quietly next to a media library, and the polite default for that is not to
      make it. Opt-in, with the exact request shown before anyone turns it on.

    - **Reuse YA-WAMF's Worker shape, with its logging turned off.** A project-operated Cloudflare
      Worker reading a D1 table is the right mechanism: it edge-caches, it avoids GitHub's rate
      limits, and it is the only way to answer the branch channels, since GitHub's releases API
      knows nothing about a dev build's commit. YA-WAMF's `/version` already does exactly this — a
      D1 read, no writes, nothing taken from the caller, `Cache-Control: no-store`. What must differ
      is `wrangler.jsonc`: YA-WAMF sets `observability.enabled: true` with `logs.enabled` and
      `invocation_logs` at a 0.1 head sampling rate, so one request in ten is recorded with its
      metadata. Optimisarr's route wants observability off, no Logpush, no Tail Worker, no Analytics
      Engine binding, and no `console.log` of anything from the request.

    - **Disclose what is recorded and for how long, including the part we do not control.** Honest
      disclosure means not overclaiming. We can say truthfully that we log nothing and store
      nothing, and that the response is a static read no request of ours writes to. We cannot say
      Cloudflare sees nothing: any hosted endpoint terminates the connection, and Cloudflare keeps
      its own aggregate edge analytics as any host would. The setting should name the destination,
      say what our side records (nothing) and for how long (not at all), say plainly that the
      connection itself is visible to the host as with any request to any server, and let the
      operator decide. A setting that calls itself "anonymous" and stops there is the thing to
      avoid.

    - **Nothing in the request that identifies an install.** No installation identifier, no version
      in a query string, no counting, no cohorts, no install totals. YA-WAMF's community
      install-count rides the same switch as its update check; that must not come across — it is the
      one part that needs an identity, and this feature should need none.

    - **Three states, not two.** Off (the default), check only when asked, and check periodically. A
      person pressing "Check now" is not a beacon, and that middle state is likely the one most
      operators actually want. Honour the proxy configuration the rest of the app uses, so an
      install that reaches the internet through one egress does not quietly open another.

    - **The sidecars are covered by the same entry, and must not each phone out.** A sidecar needs
      to know a newer sidecar exists just as the controller does, and sidecars are released on their
      own tags. The obvious implementation — every sidecar asking GitHub for itself — is the wrong
      one: it turns one disclosure into one per machine, from machines whose owners may not have
      been the ones who chose to enable anything, and it needs egress from hosts that often have
      none. A sidecar already talks to exactly one peer it trusts. So the controller makes the
      single check, when its operator has enabled it, and hands the answer back in the heartbeat
      response a sidecar is making anyway. A sidecar makes no outbound internet request of its own,
      ever, and a worker machine behind a firewall with no route out still learns it is behind.
      With the check disabled, the heartbeat carries no such field and nothing is asked of anyone.

    - **Sidecar version skew needs no network at all, and should land first.** Workers now report
      their own build on pairing and on every check-in, so the controller can already tell that a
      paired sidecar is older than the controller expects, purely from data it holds. That is the
      most useful piece of this entry, it carries none of the privacy question, and it should ship
      independently rather than waiting behind the release check. It also covers the common case
      directly: most fleets are behind because someone upgraded the container and not the machines.

    - **Evidence to call it complete.** A test that boots with no configuration and proves no
      outbound request is attempted; a test that the enabled check makes exactly one request
      carrying no identifying payload; pure comparison tests covering same-version, dev-ahead-of-
      stable, and unparseable input; a degradation test proving a failed fetch keeps the last known
      answer and never blocks or surfaces an error into a page; the Worker deployed with
      observability disabled and no log or analytics binding, proved by its own configuration in
      review; sidecar skew shown in the Workers
      tab and proved to involve no network call; a test proving a sidecar makes no outbound request
      of its own in any configuration, and that the heartbeat carries no update field while the
      controller's check is off; the sidecar surfacing "a newer version is available" in its own
      menu from what the heartbeat told it; documentation stating exactly what is sent, to whom, how
      often, and what enabling it reveals; and the new strings in all nine locales.

12. **Run the controller natively on Apple Silicon.** The published image is amd64 only, so on an
    Apple Silicon Mac it runs emulated or not at all — which is the wrong answer for a transcoder,
    where emulation is not a mild tax. The work is smaller than it looks, and the honest limitation
    needs saying as loudly as the capability.

    - **The image is closer than the pipeline is.** Every base the Dockerfile uses already publishes
      arm64: `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0`, `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0`,
      `node:26-bookworm-slim`, and the digest-pinned `mwader/static-ffmpeg:9.0.1`, whose pin is a
      manifest list carrying `linux/arm64` rather than a single-architecture manifest. The Jellyfin
      Debian repository publishes `amd64 armhf arm64`, and the sources entry already derives its
      architecture from `dpkg --print-architecture` rather than hard-coding one. So the build is
      expected to work largely as written; what does not exist is a pipeline that produces it.

    - **What actually blocks it is the publish step.** CI runs a plain `docker build`, so only the
      runner's own architecture is ever tagged and pushed. This needs buildx and a manifest list per
      tag. Prefer native arm64 runners to QEMU: an emulated build of this image is slow enough to
      matter on every push, and — more to the point — a container smoke test executed under
      emulation proves much less than one executed on the architecture it claims to support.

    - **Say plainly that there is no hardware transcoding.** Under Docker on macOS the container is
      a Linux VM: no VideoToolbox, no `/dev/dri`, no VA-API or QSV, no NVENC. An Apple Silicon
      controller is software encoding only. That belongs in the documentation and in what hardware
      detection reports, so nobody discovers it by watching a 4K encode crawl. Detection must
      degrade to a clear statement of what is available rather than erroring on absent devices.

    - **The fast path on a Mac is the sidecar, and the docs should say so.** The macOS sidecar
      already encodes with VideoToolbox natively, because it is not in a container. So the shape
      worth recommending is the controller running where the media and the `*arr` stack already
      live, with the encoding handed to a paired sidecar — which is what the work-placement setting
      exists to express. Apple Silicon support for the controller is about running the control
      plane there, not about making the container the fastest encoder on the machine.

    - **Evidence to call it complete.** A manifest list published for both architectures on every
      tag, with the existing container smoke test run natively on each rather than emulated;
      hardware detection on arm64 reporting software-only cleanly instead of failing on missing
      devices; documentation stating what acceleration is and is not available on Apple Silicon and
      recommending the sidecar for encoding; and one real end-to-end run on an Apple Silicon host
      that transcodes, verifies, and replaces a file.

13. **Run the per-title quality search where the encode runs.** The search is the expensive half of
    an adaptive job — a bounded set of sample encodes, each scored with libvmaf — and it runs on the
    control plane while the cheap half is handed to whichever machine has the GPU. That is the wrong
    way round, and on 2026-09-14 it was also the reason "prefer a worker" did nothing at all: a
    worker cannot be offered a job until a quality has been chosen, the choice is made by the
    server, and the server went straight on to encode it. There was no instant at which the
    preference could apply. The handback shipped that day — return the job to the queue once the
    quality is chosen — makes the setting work, but it is a stopgap for this entry rather than the
    answer.

    - **One lease covers the search and the encode.** This is the decision that shapes everything
      else. If one worker searches and another encodes, the source crosses the network twice, and
      these are whole video files; today it effectively crosses twice anyway, because the server
      reads it locally to search and the worker then downloads it to encode. Binding both to a
      single assignment moves it **once**, which is a larger saving than the processor time that
      prompted the idea. It also removes the round trip through the queue that the handback adds.

    - **The protocol grows a shape, and two clients implement it.** An assignment today names one
      encoder and one quality, and delivery is a candidate file. A searching assignment must instead
      carry the range to search, the measurement commands for each sample, and the policy the
      evidence will be held to — and the worker returns a chosen value and its evidence before any
      full encode begins. Much of this exists: `QualityRequirement` already ships per-window libvmaf
      commands, and `/api/workers/leases/{id}/quality` already takes raw libvmaf logs back. This is
      an extension of a conversation the two ends already have. It is still a versioned contract
      with a Swift implementation and a C# one, so the shape wants settling before either is
      written, not during.

    - **The control plane still owns the decision.** It sends the bounds, the sample windows and the
      thresholds; the worker measures and reports. A worker proposing a value the server did not
      offer, or reporting evidence that does not match the policy it was given, is refused — a score
      taken under an easier policy is evidence about something else. The server records the chosen
      value against the job exactly as it does now, so a recovery retry stays anchored to it.

    - **Safety is unchanged, and that is what makes this worth attempting.** A search only chooses a
      setting; it never authorises a replacement. The finished encode still clears the structural,
      decode, duration, tail, stream, size and configured VMAF gates on this machine before anything
      is replaced. A worker that chooses badly produces an encode that then fails verification, not
      a bad replacement. So this is an efficiency change rather than a trust one.

    - **Read why it lives in the dispatcher before moving it.** The feature is still marked
      Experimental above, and its notes say the search deliberately does not cache a decision across
      work. That is about caching rather than placement, but the two were written together, and ten
      minutes spent on the reasoning is cheaper than discovering it afterwards.

    - **Evidence to call it complete.** A worker that searches and encodes under one lease with the
      source transferred once, proved by counting the transfers; a worker's proposed quality refused
      when it is outside the offered bounds or its evidence was taken under a different policy; the
      server falling back to its own search when no worker can take the job, so a fleet that is
      absent or incapable never stalls a library; both sidecars implementing the same contract
      against the same tests; and a real adaptive job completing end to end on a worker with the
      chosen quality and its evidence recorded against the job as they are today.


## Guiding principles

- Safety beats savings.
- No original file is deleted until verification has passed.
- Every destructive action must have a rollback path.
- Defaults should be conservative and understandable. One recorded exception stands: Adaptive
  per-title VMAF defaults on for new video re-encode libraries while still labelled Experimental,
  for the reasons given under adaptive per-title VMAF quality targeting above.
- The app should feel familiar to Docker media-stack users.
- One container should be enough for normal use.
