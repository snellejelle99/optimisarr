# API reference

Optimisarr's web UI uses the same HTTP API documented here. The API is useful
for local automation, health checks, and read-only dashboards, but it is not a
stable public contract yet. Check this page against the running version before
building long-lived integrations.

The generated OpenAPI 3.1 document is checked in at [`openapi.json`](openapi.json)
and regenerated in CI from the running API. This page is the readable companion
to that machine-readable contract.

Examples below assume Optimisarr is reachable at `http://localhost:8787`.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/health
```

## Basics

- Requests and responses are JSON unless the endpoint returns media content.
- Write requests use `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.
- Validation errors return `400` with an `error` field when the endpoint can
  describe the problem.
- Readiness failures return `503` from `/api/ready` with a `detail` string.
- If `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set, protected endpoints require
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Put Optimisarr behind an authenticated reverse
  proxy before exposing it outside a trusted network; the token is a built-in
  backstop, not a full public-access security model.
- Live queue updates are also published through the SignalR hub at `/hubs/jobs`.

Common status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Request succeeded and usually returned JSON. |
| `204` | Delete-style request succeeded with no response body. |
| `400` | Request body or query value was invalid. |
| `401` | `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set and the request did not include the correct token. |
| `404` | Requested library, media file, job, preview, exclusion, or replacement was not found. |
| `409` | The requested action is not allowed in the current state. |
| `503` | Readiness failed; check the response detail before starting work. |

## Authentication

`GET /api/health`, `GET /api/ready`, and `GET /api/auth/status` are always open
so health checks and clients can detect whether a token is required.

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8787/api/auth/status
```

Response:

```json
{ "required": true }
```

When `required` is `true`, send the configured token on protected requests:

```bash
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer change-this-long-random-token" \
  http://localhost:8787/api/settings
```

The SignalR hub at `/hubs/jobs` accepts the same token through its WebSocket
`access_token` query parameter. Ordinary `/api` routes reject query tokens. A
successful bearer-authenticated API request also establishes a derived HttpOnly,
same-site session cookie so native browser media requests can authenticate
without placing the admin token in their URLs.

## Common Recipes

### Check Whether Optimisarr Is Ready

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8787/api/ready
```

Ready response:

```json
{ "status": "ready" }
```

If the service is not ready, the endpoint returns `503` with a detail string such
as an unwritable path or unavailable media tool.

### Scan One Library

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/libraries/1/scan
```

Response:

```json
{
  "discovered": 5426,
  "added": 0,
  "updated": 0,
  "skippedUnsettled": 0
}
```

### See What Would Be Queued

```bash
curl -fsS "http://localhost:8787/api/candidates?libraryId=1"
```

Each candidate includes `eligible` and `reason`. Use this before enqueueing a
large library.

### Enqueue Eligible Files

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/libraries/1/enqueue
```

Response:

```json
{
  "enqueued": 10,
  "alreadyQueued": 2,
  "ineligible": 50,
  "importing": 0
}
```

### Watch Queue State

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8787/api/queue/status
curl -fsS http://localhost:8787/api/jobs
```

Use `waitingReason` and `blockedReason` from `/api/queue/status` to understand
why jobs are not starting.

### Pause and Resume Queue Work

Manual pause is operational state, not portable configuration. It persists across restarts but is
not included in a settings export. Pausing prevents new jobs and automatic replacements from
starting. On Linux and macOS, Optimisarr also suspends running transcodes in place; verification
already underway finishes. Other platforms use a dispatch-only pause and report that limitation.

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/queue/pause
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/queue/resume
```

The response is the current queue status. `manualPauseMode` is `inactive`, `suspended`, `partial`,
or `dispatchOnly`. `runningEncodesSuspended`, `suspendedEncodeCount`, and
`pauseFailedEncodeCount` distinguish a complete process suspension from a partial or unsupported
one. A resume that cannot continue every still-running suspended process returns `409` and keeps
dispatch paused so the operation can be retried safely.

### Replace Verified Jobs

Replacement is state-changing. It is refused while dry-run mode is enabled and
should only be automated after you trust the library rules.

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/jobs/42/replace

# Replace every normal job that is currently verified and ready.
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/jobs/replace-ready
```

The single-job response is a replacement/quarantine record. Keep the returned `id` if you want to
approve or roll back later. The bulk response reports `attempted`, `replaced`, and a `failures` array;
each eligible job still creates its own replacement record and rollback remains per file. A failure
does not prevent later eligible jobs in the snapshot from being replaced.

### Roll Back or Approve a Replacement

```bash
# Restore the quarantined original and remove the replacement.
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/replacements/7/rollback

# Permanently remove the quarantined original.
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/replacements/7/approve
```

Approval is permanent. Rollback is available only while the original still
exists in quarantine.

## Health and System

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Liveness check: the web process is responding. |
| `GET` | `/api/ready` | Readiness check: database, writable paths, FFmpeg, and ffprobe are usable. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/status` | Authentication discovery: whether `OPTIMISARR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is configured. |
| `GET` | `/api/diagnostics` | Admin support snapshot: version, environment, settings, library and integration summaries, stats, and the failure summary. Assembled from non-secret data only (no tokens, API keys, or webhook URLs). Protected by the admin token when one is set. |
| `GET` | `/api/diagnostics/capture` | Latest opt-in capture session, or `null`. |
| `POST` | `/api/diagnostics/capture` | Start a session with `durationHours` (`1`, `24`, `168`, or `null` for until stopped), optional `scopedJobId`, and `includePaths` (default `false`). Returns `409` if another session is active. |
| `POST` | `/api/diagnostics/capture/{id}/stop` | Stop a session; its evidence remains downloadable until retention removes it. |
| `GET` | `/api/diagnostics/capture/{id}/jobs/{jobId}/bundle` | Download a structured JSON bundle for a job in that session. The manifest lists omissions and whether full paths were included. |
| `GET` | `/api/system/tools` | Required FFmpeg/ffprobe checks plus optional CPU/CUDA VMAF-FFmpeg capabilities; each result includes `required`. |
| `GET` | `/api/system/hardware` | Hardware accelerator and encoder detection. Use `?refresh=true` to retest. |
| `GET` | `/api/fs/browse?path=/data` | Folder browser for directories visible inside the container. |

## First-run setup

Setup progress is admin-token protected and intentionally separate from configuration backup. It
does not contain secrets and is not exported between installations.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/setup` | Read the versioned completed/current step and completion state. |
| `GET` | `/api/setup/readiness` | Non-destructively check database, config/work/quarantine paths and media tools, then return visible encoder, VMAF and schedule recommendations from proved capabilities. |
| `PUT` | `/api/setup/progress` | Persist one completed step in order; repeated writes are idempotent. |
| `POST` | `/api/setup/complete` | Complete setup from the final review step. Does not start work. |
| `POST` | `/api/setup/apply` | Validate and atomically apply the reviewed settings and opted-in recommendations, then complete setup. A duplicate submission returns the existing receipt without changing the applied plan. |
| `POST` | `/api/setup/restart` | Return to step one while preserving libraries and settings. |

Health response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "optimisarr",
  "version": "1.0.0.0",
  "checkedAt": "2026-06-27T08:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## Settings

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/settings` | Read global queue, hardware, and replacement settings. |
| `PUT` | `/api/settings` | Save global settings. Body is the full settings object. |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/cleanup` | Preview files and bytes currently eligible under the saved cleanup policy without changing anything. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/cleanup` | Run the saved cleanup policy now. Body is the preview returned by `GET`; a changed preview returns `409`. Success returns the execution-time preview, processed count, and actual reclaimed bytes. |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/export` | Export configuration snapshot. Contains provider secrets. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/import` | Validate and merge a configuration snapshot. |

Settings fields include:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrentJobs": 1,
  "minFreeDiskBytes": 10737418240,
  "cpuThreadLimit": 0,
  "libraryScanIntervalHours": 1,
  "encoderMode": "Auto",
  "hardwareDecode": true,
  "hdrToneMapMode": "Software",
  "remoteWorkersEnabled": false,
  "workerVerificationRequired": true,
  "workloadConcurrencyMode": "Automatic",
  "nonVideoSlots": 0,
  "evidenceValidationSlots": 1,
  "automaticNonVideoSlots": 0,
  "automaticEvidenceValidationSlots": 1,
  "replacementAllowCrossFilesystem": false,
  "dryRunMode": false,
  "replacementQuarantineRetentionDays": 0
}
```

`remoteWorkersEnabled` enables the preview worker service when available.
`workerVerificationRequired` requires complete worker verification for newly issued remote
full-file video assignments. It defaults on for new installations, while upgrades keep their
previous choice, and is separate from per-library work placement.
Older clients that omit this field from an update retain the installation's current choice.
`workloadConcurrencyMode` is `Automatic` or `Manual`. In manual mode, `nonVideoSlots` (0–4)
adds audio/image work beside the primary video limit, and `evidenceValidationSlots` (1–4)
limits concurrent validation of strict sidecar evidence. Automatic mode computes those limits
from the server's CPU and memory; the `automatic*Slots` response fields show that recommendation
and are read-only. Older clients that omit the workload fields retain the current values.
`GET /api/queue/status` includes `workloadLanes` with each lane's active, capacity, waiting,
and reason values. Queued jobs enter lane waiting counts only inside their library window;
delivered worker results always await a verdict. The Schedule view explains closed windows.
A bounded finalisation lane covers replacement and
rollback; worker slots remain controlled by the paired sidecars.
`remoteWorkersAvailable` is returned as server capability information, not a toggle that can enable
the feature without its environment flag. See [Remote Workers](#remote-workers) for the contract.

`replacementQuarantineRetentionDays` retains its historical wire name for API and
configuration-backup compatibility. It is the general cleanup-retention window:
the startup/six-hour sweep applies it to quarantined originals and failed outputs
under `/work`. A value of `0` retains both indefinitely. Expiring a failed output
clears only its scratch file and path; its job diagnostics and measured output size
remain available through the jobs and failures APIs.

The cleanup preview counts only records the shared timed-cleanup policy can act on
and measures files that currently exist on disk. Dry-run excludes quarantined
originals but still includes eligible failed scratch outputs. The `POST` endpoint
re-evaluates eligibility and requires it to match the submitted preview. If a retry
or background sweep changed the policy, counts, or bytes, it returns `409` without
deleting anything so the operator can review and confirm the new preview.

## Libraries and Inventory

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/library-options` | Available media types, rule profiles, codecs, containers, HDR modes, portable encoder-effort choices, and image formats. |
| `GET` | `/api/libraries` | List configured libraries. |
| `GET` | `/api/libraries/{id}/access` | Check whether the configured path exists and is readable/writable. |
| `POST` | `/api/libraries` | Create a library. |
| `PUT` | `/api/libraries/{id}` | Update a library. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/libraries/{id}` | Delete a library record. |
| `POST` | `/api/libraries/{id}/scan` | Scan one library. |
| `POST` | `/api/libraries/scan` | Scan all enabled libraries. |
| `GET` | `/api/media?libraryId={id}` | List discovered files. Omit `libraryId` for all libraries. Optional `status`, `search` (path substring), and `page`/`pageSize`; the pre-paging total is returned in `X-Total-Count`. |
| `POST` | `/api/media/{id}/probe` | Probe one media file. |
| `GET` | `/api/candidates?libraryId={id}` | Show rule decisions for discovered files. |
| `GET` | `/api/candidates/summary` | Eligible/skipped counts per library. |
| `GET` | `/api/inventory` | Inventory page: files paired with their rule verdict, filtered (`show`=all/eligible/skipped/unprobed), searched (`search`), and paged (`page`/`pageSize`). Returns the page, the filtered total, and per-filter counts. |

Create and update library bodies use the same shape. Common fields:

```json
{
  "name": "TV",
  "path": "/data/media/tv",
  "mediaType": "TV",
  "ruleProfile": "ScottsSettings",
  "enabled": true,
  "priority": 0,
  "minFileSizeBytes": null,
  "maxHeight": null,
  "targetVideoCodec": null,
  "targetContainer": null,
  "hdrHandling": null,
  "qualityCrf": null,
  "videoQualityStrategy": "Fixed",
  "workPlacement": "Anywhere",
  "encoderPreset": "balanced",
  "vmafQualityGateEnabled": false,
  "minVmafHarmonicMean": 93,
  "minVmafMin": 80,
  "minVmafCatastrophicMin": 50,
  "clipVmafEnabled": false,
  "vmafFrameSubsample": 1,
  "durationTolerancePercent": 1,
  "requireAudioRetained": true,
  "requireSubtitlesRetained": false,
  "requireSizeReduction": true,
  "minimumSizeSavingPercent": null,
  "maximumSizeSavingPercent": null,
  "audioLoudnessGateEnabled": false,
  "maxLoudnessDriftLufs": 1,
  "audioClippingGateEnabled": false,
  "maxTruePeakDbtp": 0,
  "imageQualityGateEnabled": true,
  "minimumImageSsim": 0.95,
  "imageMetadataGateEnabled": true,
  "audioTargetCodec": null,
  "audioBitrateKbps": null,
  "downmixToStereo": false,
  "targetImageFormat": null,
  "imageQuality": null,
  "autoEnqueueEnabled": false,
  "autoEnqueueWindowStart": "00:00",
  "autoEnqueueWindowEnd": "00:00",
  "autoReplace": false
}
```

`minimumSizeSavingPercent` and `maximumSizeSavingPercent` are optional video re-encode gates when
size reduction is required. At 10% minimum and 65% maximum, a 1,000-byte source accepts a
completed candidate from 350 through 900 bytes, inclusive. The minimum cannot exceed the maximum;
null preserves the respective unbounded behavior. Compatibility jobs that disable size reduction
ignore both. Current Mac and Windows sidecars reject a candidate below the final-size floor before
final full-file VMAF verification or upload; the server also verifies the frozen policy before replacement.

Use `/api/library-options` for valid enum values. Unknown or invalid values are
rejected. `encoderPreset` retains its historical API name but new clients should store a portable
encoder effort: `quick`, `balanced`, `efficient`, or `null` for the encoder default. Former
x264/x265 values, NVENC `p1`–`p7`, and SVT-AV1 `0`–`13` values remain accepted and are preserved
exactly for backwards compatibility; dispatch resolves a safe equivalent if another encoder family
is selected. `videoQualityStrategy` accepts `Fixed` or `AdaptiveVmaf`. When both the strategy and
VMAF fields are omitted for a video re-encode library, the API creates an AdaptiveVmaf library with
the Visually lossless 93/80/50 floors, representative-window scoring, and every-frame sampling.
An explicitly disabled VMAF gate keeps the omitted strategy on Fixed, as do non-video and remux-only
libraries. An explicitly supplied `AdaptiveVmaf` is accepted only when
`vmafQualityGateEnabled` is `true`; invalid combinations return `400` rather than silently changing
the requested policy. `workPlacement` accepts `Anywhere` (the default when omitted), `LocalOnly`,
`PreferWorker`, or `WorkerOnly`, and says where the library's video re-encodes may run once remote
workers are switched on; it is stored but has no effect while they are off.

Verification fields are owned by each library. The API accepts the complete shape for every media
type, but the UI shows only applicable controls: video can configure subtitle retention and VMAF,
video and audio can configure duration and audio-fidelity gates, and images can configure SSIM and
EXIF/ICC retention. Omitted verification fields use conservative defaults. Existing databases and
version-one configuration backups materialise their former global values into each library.

## Preview

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/media/{id}/preview` | Start a throwaway preview encode for one media file. |
| `GET` | `/api/preview/{jobId}` | Read preview status, comparison stats, and verification report. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/preview/{jobId}` | Remove preview output. |
| `GET` | `/api/media/{id}/content` | Stream original media content for comparison. |
| `GET` | `/api/preview/{jobId}/content` | Stream preview output for comparison. |

Long video previews may be segment-only. The response includes `clipped: true`
when the verification report is for a sample rather than the whole file.
`clipStartSeconds` is the sample's position in the original and
`clipDurationSeconds` is its requested comparison length; both are `null` for a
full-file response. Clients can subtract each side's start to maintain one
source-relative playback timeline. A user-requested Preview bypasses its
library's automatic optimise window, but still waits for queue capacity, minimum
free space, a manual pause, or active-media protection.

## Personal blind quality calibration

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/libraries/{id}/calibration/sources` | List probed video, audio, and still-image sources suitable for a personal quality check. |
| `POST` | `/api/libraries/{id}/calibration` | Start a short-lived session and its disposable candidate clips. Body: `{ "mediaFileId": 123, "diagnosticsEnabled": false, "ignoreActiveStreams": false }`. Diagnostics reveal candidate details. The default-off stream exception applies only to the session's calibration jobs; normal jobs remain activity-paused. |
| `GET` | `/api/calibration` | List every active quality-check session, including any revealed result. Listing does not extend an abandoned session's lifetime. |
| `GET` | `/api/calibration/{id}` | Read preparation progress, the marked original reference plus anonymous media-specific candidates, or a revealed result. |
| `POST` | `/api/calibration/{id}/classifications` | Classify every anonymous candidate and reveal its settings. Body: `{ "classifications": { "A": "Acceptable", "B": "VisiblyWorse", "…": "…" } }`. |
| `POST` | `/api/calibration/{id}/apply` | Explicitly apply a recommended video preset or media quality to the library, if its relevant settings have not changed. |
| `GET` | `/api/calibration/{id}/variants/{variant}/samples/{sampleIndex}/content` | Stream one scene or excerpt for `ORIGINAL` or anonymous candidate `A`–`E`. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/calibration/{id}` | Cancel the session and remove its scratch media and non-failed disposable jobs. A failed job keeps only its diagnostic row until **Clear errored** removes it. |

Video calibration creates three 12-second scenes for the four shuffled library-slider presets plus one marked original reference.
Its reference is the unchanged video bitstream; when a mid-file stream copy needs packets from the
preceding keyframe, its sample `startSeconds` identifies the matching presentation window. Video
samples retain the complete preset output, including its container, audio contract, and concrete
configured quality. Calibration deliberately bypasses the library's Adaptive per-title VMAF search:
normal jobs retain that path, while a personal check measures VMAF once on each completed 12-second
scene instead of recursively preparing three 40-second quality-search windows inside every scene.
Scores remain absent from the API until classifications reveal the lineup;
then every non-original `result.variants[]` entry includes a `vmaf` summary and its three underlying
`samples`. `harmonicMean` is frame-weighted across measured scenes, `fifthPercentile` is the lowest
scene fifth percentile, and `minimum` is the lowest individual-frame score. `measuredSamples` and
per-scene `error` fields make partial or unavailable measurement explicit. VMAF is objective evidence
only in this personal check: it neither rejects a structurally valid sample nor changes the user's
preference-led recommendation. Music uses three 15-second excerpts with a lossless
FLAC reference and returns a per-sample `gainDb` that brings every anonymous version to the same
quietest measured level. Still images use a lossless PNG reference and return `startSeconds: 0` and
`gainDb: 0`.

All candidate and reference media lives under `/work/calibration`. These jobs are excluded from the
normal queue and can never enter replacement. Active requests extend the session; an abandoned
session expires after two hours, and all session state is discarded on restart. Failed job rows
retain only their error, verification report, and process diagnostics after the scratch media and
session are removed, so the failure API remains useful after the lab closes. The original file
is only read. A completed result does not alter settings: only the separate `apply` request may
change the relevant library preset or quality, and it queues no media work.

Variant labels and URLs are opaque until reveal when `diagnosticsEnabled` is false. With diagnostics
enabled, each variant includes its profile, codec, actual container, requested/effective quality,
and encoder for troubleshooting; clients must clearly state that the session is no longer blind.
Browser verification clients should replace the `src` of one video element, report that element's
resolved `currentSrc`, and offer a direct link to that exact resource rather than presenting an
application-supplied active-file label as proof of a switch.
Normal blind clients must not display encoder, quality, bitrate, estimated size, or raw media
duration during this phase. Drive each variant from its sample `durationSeconds` and `startSeconds`,
preserve one relative playback position, and wait for `seeked` before showing a newly selected video;
otherwise timing can become a side channel. Submit exactly one `Indistinguishable`, `Acceptable`, or
`VisiblyWorse` classification for every variant. If any stream cannot be decoded, fail closed.

## Queue

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/libraries/{id}/enqueue` | Enqueue eligible files for one library. |
| `GET` | `/api/queue/status` | Read dispatch blockers and the exact manual-pause/suspension state. |
| `POST` | `/api/queue/pause` | Pause new dispatch and automatic replacement; suspend running transcodes where supported. |
| `POST` | `/api/queue/resume` | Resume suspended transcodes, then reopen dispatch and automatic replacement. |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | List queue jobs. Optional filters `status`, `libraryId`, `category`, `since`, `until`, and paging `page`/`pageSize`. |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs?status=Failed` | List jobs filtered by status. |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/failures` | Failure summary for normal work and failed preview/personal-quality comparisons. Optional `libraryId` scopes it to one library. Samples identify `jobType` and include structured failed `verificationChecks` (`name`, `outcome`, and measured `detail`). |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/{id}/log` | FFmpeg/process log for a failed job (plain text; `404` when none was captured). |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/{id}/artwork` | Proxied artwork for a job when a provider can resolve it. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/cancel` | Cancel an active job. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/jobs/{id}` | Remove a clearable job. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/retry` | Retry a failed or cancelled job. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/replace-ready` | Replace all currently verified, ready normal jobs through the rollback-safe quarantine path; report per-job failures without stopping later replacements. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/clear?scope=errored` | Clear failed jobs. Scope can be `errored`, `finished`, or `all`. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/clear-pending` | Clear queued and ready-to-replace jobs and stop running work. |

Job responses include status, progress, priority, FFmpeg arguments, selected
encoder, output size, verification result, verification report JSON, the
classified failure category (when failed), and timestamps. When paging is used,
the total number of matches before paging is returned in the `X-Total-Count`
response header. Failure categories are `SizeSaving`, `Verification`,
`ContainerIncompatibility`, `BitmapSubtitles`, `ReplacementCollision`, `SourceMissing`,
`InvalidConfiguration`, and `Other`.

Failed preview and personal-quality jobs never appear in the normal queue feed. Their scratch media
is still deleted, but the small failed row remains available to `/api/jobs/failures`,
`/api/jobs/{id}/log`, and the diagnostics bundle until `POST /api/jobs/clear?scope=errored` removes
it. This makes an interactive failure diagnosable without retaining candidate media or reading the
application database directly. Start with `/api/jobs/failures`, find the sample whose `jobType` is
`Preview`, then use its `jobId` with `/api/preview/{jobId}` for the complete verification report or
`/api/jobs/{jobId}/log` for captured process output.

Common job states include `Queued`, `Probing`, `Transcoding`, `Verifying`,
`ReadyToReplace`, `Completed`, `Failed`, and `Cancelled`. A job is re-checked
against its library's current rules immediately before it transcodes; one that
is no longer a candidate (e.g. an already-efficient source enqueued before the
efficiency floor existed) is marked `Cancelled` with an `errorMessage` of
`Skipped before encoding: …` rather than being transcoded and failed.

Verification reports are stored as JSON in `verificationReportJson`:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Duration",
      "outcome": "Passed",
      "detail": "Output duration is within tolerance."
    }
  ]
}
```

Each job row carries remote-work fields: `workerName` (the sidecar holding, or having
delivered, the job; null for local work), `remoteStage` (`Claimed`, `FetchingSource`, `Encoding`
or `Delivering` while leased, otherwise null), and `waitingForWorker` (a queued job its library's
placement keeps off this server until a worker takes it, judged by the same rule the dispatcher
applies). `sidecarVerification` identifies an assignment whose media checks ran on the worker;
`finalizing` is true only while this server is safely moving the verified output into place.

## Exclusions

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/exclusions?libraryId={id}` | List path-keyed exclusions. Omit `libraryId` for all. |
| `POST` | `/api/exclusions` | Exclude a media file from future optimisation. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/exclusions/{id}` | Remove an exclusion. |

Example body:

```json
{
  "mediaFileId": 123,
  "reason": "Already tuned manually"
}
```

## Replacement and Quarantine

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/replace` | Replace the original for a verified job. Refused in dry-run mode. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/replace-ready` | Replace all currently verified, ready normal jobs. Each original is quarantined and recorded independently; unverified or no-longer-ready jobs are skipped. |
| `GET` | `/api/replacements` | List quarantine/replacement records. |
| `GET` | `/api/replacements/{id}` | Read one replacement with verification details. |
| `GET` | `/api/replacements/{id}/original/content` | Stream the quarantined original for comparison. |
| `GET` | `/api/replacements/{id}/replacement/content` | Stream the replacement for comparison. |
| `POST` | `/api/replacements/{id}/rollback` | Restore the original and remove the replacement. |
| `POST` | `/api/replacements/{id}/approve` | Permanently remove the quarantined original. |
| `POST` | `/api/replacements/clear` | Clear finished replacement history rows. |

Rollback is available only while the original still exists in quarantine.

Replacement statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Replaced` | The original is still in quarantine and can be rolled back or approved. |
| `RolledBack` | The original was restored and the replacement removed. |
| `Purged` | The quarantined original was deleted by approval or retention. Rollback is no longer available. |

## Remote Workers

Optional remote transcoding sidecars. Optimisarr stays the control plane and the sole authority over
destructive transitions: a worker contributes spare capacity and can never replace, quarantine, move,
or delete an original.

Pairing is PIN-based. The operator issues a code in Optimisarr and types it into the sidecar along
with this server's URL. The code lives five minutes, redeems once, and is destroyed after five wrong
guesses rather than throttled, so a code short enough to retype is safe on its attempt budget rather
than its length.

`POST /api/workers/pair` authenticates with the one-time PIN and does not require the admin token.
Heartbeat, claim, and `/api/workers/leases/...` routes authenticate with the paired worker's bearer
credential. They do not require or grant access to the admin token. Operator routes such as issuing
pairing codes, listing machines, drain/resume, revocation, and forgetting a worker use the configured
admin authentication.

The credential is returned exactly once, in the pairing response. Optimisarr stores only its SHA-256
fingerprint and cannot reproduce it. Revoking clears the fingerprint, which ends the worker's access
outright because an absent fingerprint matches nothing; the row is kept for the audit trail.

Remote workers are a preview: the whole surface exists only when the container starts with
`OPTIMISARR_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_WORKERS=true`; without it every route below answers `403` with code
`workers.unavailable`, and `PUT /api/settings` refuses `remoteWorkersEnabled: true` with `400`.

Remote workers are opt-in. While the `workers.remoteEnabled` setting is off — the default, and the
value any upgrade inherits — `POST /api/workers/pairing-code`, `POST /api/workers/pair`, and
`POST /api/workers/heartbeat` all answer `403 workers.disabled`. `GET /api/workers` and
`DELETE /api/workers/{id}` stay available so an operator can still see and remove what is paired
after switching the feature off.

Capabilities are named, not numbered. `vmaf` is `None`, `Cpu`, or `Cuda` (case-insensitive on the
way in; omitting it means the worker claims no VMAF support). An unrecognised name is rejected with
`worker.vmaf.invalid` rather than silently treated as `None`, so a typo cannot quietly downgrade a
capable worker. Names are used because this contract is implemented by separately-versioned
sidecars: an ordinal would change meaning if the set ever gained a member, and that value decides
whether a job may be offered to a worker at all.

A worker checks in every 30 seconds and is treated as offline after 2 minutes of silence. Those are
different numbers on purpose: declaring a worker offline on one missed beat would make the status
flap on a single dropped packet. The control plane stamps the last-seen time from its own clock, so
a sidecar with a wrong clock cannot claim to be alive, and the heartbeat response carries the
interval so a sidecar paces itself from the server rather than hard-coding a value that could drift
out of step with the threshold. The response also says whether the worker is `draining`, so a
sidecar learns of a drain on its next check-in rather than at the end of its job.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/workers/pairing-code` | Issue a pairing PIN, replacing any previous one. |
| `GET` | `/api/workers/pairing-code` | Read the PIN currently on screen. `204` when none is live — the resting state, not an error. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/workers/pairing-code` | Withdraw the active PIN. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/pair` | Redeem a PIN and register a sidecar. Open route; the PIN is the credential. Returns the worker credential once. Optional `sidecarVersion` records the build the sidecar is running. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/heartbeat` | A paired sidecar checks in and reports free scratch space and current concurrency. Open route; authenticated by the worker credential as `Authorization: Bearer`, not the admin token. `401` when the credential is absent, unknown, or revoked. Optional `sidecarVersion` refreshes the recorded build; omitting it leaves the last one reported, so an older sidecar cannot blank it. Optional `cpuBusyFraction` and `gpuBusyFraction` (0-1) record how busy the machine is; each is independent, omitting one leaves the last reading, and a value outside 0-1 is dropped rather than clamped. |
| `GET` | `/api/workers` | List paired workers with an `online` flag the server computes from its own liveness rule, `activeJobs` (each with `stage` and `progress`), `sidecarVersion` — the build the machine reports running, empty when it reports none — `cpuBusyFraction` and `gpuBusyFraction` (0-1, null when the worker has not said or is offline; GPU is utilisation only and reads low when a hardware encode runs on a separate media engine) — and `lastProblem`, the most recent thing the server refused or discarded from that worker: a lapsed lease, a candidate from the wrong source or with the wrong hash, a delivered candidate that failed verification. Never returns credential fingerprints. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/workers/{id}` | Revoke a worker. Clears its credential and drains it; keeps the record. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/{id}/drain` | Ask a worker to finish what it holds and take no more. Its leases still renew and deliver; only new claims are refused. Idempotent; returns the worker row with `drainRequestedAt` set and `heldLeases`, the jobs the drain is waiting on. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/workers/{id}/drain` | Resume a drained worker. `409 worker.revoked` for a revoked worker, which can only come back by pairing again. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/{id}/forget` | Remove a worker record and its lease history. Admin authentication; `409 worker.stillWorking` while it holds any job. Unlike revocation, this removes the displayed record. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/claim` | Ask for work. Returns one assignment, or `204` when nothing matches the worker's proved capabilities — the ordinary answer, not an error. Worker credential. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/renew` | Extend a claim. Optional body `{ "stage": "FetchingSource" \| "Encoding" \| "Measuring" \| "Delivering", "encodedSeconds": 123.4 }` says where the worker is, and optional `cpuBusyFraction`/`gpuBusyFraction` say how busy its machine is; the server scales encoded seconds against the source duration into the job's progress and pushes it over `jobProgress`. `400 worker.lease.stageInvalid` for an unknown stage, `403` if the lease belongs to another worker, `409` once it has lapsed. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/quality-probe` | Report an assigned adaptive sample's quality, encoded size and VMAF logs. Worker credential. The server advances the bounded search and returns the next step or the selected quality and final encode arguments; the worker does not select its own final quality. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/quality` | Report the libvmaf JSON logs for the commands the assignment carried, with `sourceSha256` and `candidateSha256`. The server parses and pools them itself and stores the result on the lease; `400 worker.quality.windowCount` / `worker.quality.logInvalid`, `409 worker.quality.notRequested` when the assignment asked for no measurement, `409 worker.quality.sourceMismatch` for another source. Evidence is used at verification only if the candidate then delivered carries the same hash. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/verification` | Submit full verification evidence for the lease's contract, bound to source and candidate hashes. Worker credential. A matching retry is idempotent; a different second report returns `409 worker.verification.alreadyRecorded`. A wrong contract or hash returns `409`. Negative/incomplete evidence is retained so strict verification can fail the job without local fallback. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/release` | Give a job back. It returns to the queue immediately. |
| `GET` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/result/offset` | How many bytes of a resumable delivery the server holds for this lease (`bytes`). Zero before the first chunk. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/result` | Append one chunk at `X-Optimisarr-Offset`. `409 worker.result.offsetMismatch` with the real `bytes` when the offsets disagree, so the worker resumes from the truth. Staged by lease, so a resumed upload can only continue its own transfer. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/result/complete` | Finish a chunked delivery with the two hash headers and no body. The assembled file is hashed and accepted, or refused and discarded, exactly as a whole upload; `409 worker.result.nothingStaged` when no chunk arrived. |
| `POST` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/result` | Deliver the encoded candidate in one request. Requires `X-Optimisarr-Source-Sha256` and `X-Optimisarr-Candidate-Sha256`; `202` when accepted, `409` when the source does not match, the upload does not match its declared hash, or the lease is no longer held. |
| `GET` | `/api/workers/leases/{leaseId}/source` | Stream the source for a held lease. Supports `Range` for resumable transfer, and returns `X-Optimisarr-Source-Sha256` so the worker can verify what it received. |

A delivered candidate is written to the same work directory a local transcode would have used, and
the job moves to `AwaitingVerification` — never directly to `ReadyToReplace`. The server must still
evaluate all required gates before replacement is possible. Delivering a result never touches the
original.

The assignment's `quality` block carries the server's libvmaf command per measurement window
(`commands`, with `{{distorted}}`, `{{reference}}` and `{{log}}` placeholders) and the `sampling`
those windows represent, fixed at claim and recorded on the lease. The worker returns the raw logs
with both file hashes before delivering the candidate. The server parses and pools quality itself;
it does not accept a worker-supplied pass/fail verdict.

With `workerVerificationRequired: false` (an explicit opt-out), usable remote quality evidence avoids the
server's VMAF pass while the remaining verification media checks run on the server. Missing,
mismatched, or insufficient quality evidence triggers a local VMAF measurement with the reason
reported on the worker's card. Hardware decode is selected only when the worker proved it and it
matches the encoder family; decoder-corruption recovery uses software decode.

With `workerVerificationRequired: true`, new full-file video assignments carry a `fullVerification`
contract and require protocol 2. The worker posts both probes, full candidate decode health,
source/candidate video timestamps, source audio timestamps, and any requested audio measurements
to `/verification`, as well as VMAF logs to `/quality` when required. The server validates contract
and file identity and applies the frozen verification policy. Missing or invalid evidence fails the
job without launching local verification media tools. Existing leases retain their assigned mode;
updated sidecars renegotiate protocol on heartbeat without re-pairing.

This setting does not select work placement: use library `workPlacement: "WorkerOnly"` as well to
prevent local video encoding while remote workers are enabled. Scanning, initial probes,
assignment preparation, transfers/hashing, persistence, policy evaluation, replacement, and rollback
remain server responsibilities. See [Remote workers](setup/remote-workers.md) for the UI controls.

Checks run in an order chosen for what each protects: authenticate first, so nothing about a lease
is revealed to a caller with no claim on it; then prove the claim is still held, which covers both
the late result and the duplicate delivery; then prove the candidate was encoded from this job's
source; and only then is anything written to disk. The upload is streamed and hashed as it arrives,
under a temporary name, so a transfer that dies part-way never leaves something resembling a
finished candidate.

The source route takes no path, filename, or library parameter, by design. A worker presents a lease
id and the server resolves the file from it, so a paired sidecar can only ever read the exact
original the control plane already assigned to it — there is no shape of request that reads anything
else. The original is opened shared and read-only, and access ends the moment the lease stops being
held, so releasing a job also ends the worker's reach into the library.

A claimed job leaves the `Queued` status for `Leased`, which is how the local queue stops seeing it:
the dispatcher selects on `Queued`, so the exclusion is structural rather than a check a future
query could forget. Releasing a claim, or a lease lapsing, returns the job to `Queued`.

Lapsed leases are reclaimed whenever a worker asks for work, so a job whose holder went silent
returns to the queue without a background sweeper needing to be running. A lease outlives the point
at which its holder would be declared offline, so a job is never handed to a second worker while the
first still counts as reachable.

## Live Updates

The UI connects to SignalR at `/hubs/jobs`. It receives job-list change events
and live progress updates while FFmpeg is running. Use the HTTP endpoints above
for durable state; treat hub messages as a convenience stream.

## Safety Notes for Automation

- Prefer dry-run mode while testing scripts.
- Read candidates before enqueueing.
- Read verification reports before replacing.
- Never call approve automatically unless you have an independent backup or a
  deliberate retention policy.
- Do not expose these endpoints directly to the internet; use an authenticated
  reverse proxy.
