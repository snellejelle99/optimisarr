# Optimisarr engineering history

Detailed, dated engineering record: what shipped, the per-phase plan, and current status.
The forward-looking summary lives in [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md).

**Corrected on dev (2026-09-01) — no job could ever be offered to a remote worker.** The claim
route builds its `JobRequirements` with `VideoEncoder: job.VideoEncoder ?? string.Empty`, and
`Job.VideoEncoder` is assigned in exactly one place: `QueueDispatcher`, when a *local* transcode
resolves an encoder. Its own doc comment says as much — "so the UI can show whether it ran on the
GPU or CPU". A queued job has never dispatched, so the value is null, and
`WorkerCapabilityMatcher` refuses an unnamed encoder because "an unnamed encoder is a malformed
assignment, not a wildcard". Every claim fell through to `204`.

That refusal is right; the requirement was wrong. Two endpoint test suites missed it because both
construct a queued job with `VideoEncoder = "libx265"` set by hand — a row the application never
writes. Tests that build state the production code cannot produce will agree with themselves
forever. A test now queues a job the way the app does and pins the `204`, so the gap is visible
rather than inferred, and it will fail the moment an assignment can name an encoder properly.

The fix is not to populate the column earlier. The encoder recorded on a job is the one *this
machine* resolved, which for a Mac worker would usually be the wrong answer anyway — a job marked
`libx265` would never match a machine advertising `hevc_videotoolbox`. The encoder has to be
resolved *for the worker* from its proved capabilities at claim time, which is part of the resolved
encode policy the assignment does not yet carry: `AssignmentDto` names an encoder and a VMAF
capability and nothing else — no quality, container, effort, audio, HDR treatment, track removals,
or thresholds. A worker holding one cannot know what to encode. That payload is the keystone the
rest of the distributed path waits on.

Noted alongside it: the assignment hands the worker `job.MediaFile.Path`, the server's absolute
library path. The source route was deliberately built to take no path — "a worker presents a lease
and the server resolves the file" — so leaking the layout through the assignment works against that
design and should go when the payload is rebuilt.

**Corrected on dev (2026-08-24) — worker capabilities cross the wire as names, not ordinals.** The
pairing slice exposed `VmafCapability` directly on its DTOs, making it the only enum in the whole
generated OpenAPI document rendered as `{"type": "integer"}`. That was justified at the time as
matching the API's convention. It did not: `SaveArrConnectionRequest.Type` and
`SaveNotificationTargetRequest.Type` are `string?` on the wire and parsed into enums by a
`Parsed*` record, `JobDto` carries `job.Status.ToString()`, and the calibration report serialises
through `JsonStringEnumConverter`. Enums already reached the wire as strings everywhere; the worker
DTOs were the exception, not the rule.

The reason it matters more here than it would elsewhere is that this contract is implemented by
separately-versioned third-party sidecars. Optimisarr's own web client ships from this repository at
the same version as the server and cannot disagree about what `2` means; a native tray app can lag
or lead by months. Inserting a member into `VmafCapability` would silently change what an existing
paired worker is believed to support — and that value gates whether a job may be offered to it, so a
quietly wrong capability would arrive through a side door the protocol negotiation was built to
close.

`PairRequest.Vmaf` is now `string?`, parsed at the boundary with an error naming the valid values,
following the same shape as the jobs endpoint's `job.status.invalid`. A missing value means the
worker claims no VMAF support — a real answer — while anything unrecognised is refused, so a typo
cannot quietly downgrade a capable worker to `None`. `WorkerDto.Vmaf` is the name, which also let
the web client drop an ordinal-indexed label lookup in favour of the value itself. An end-to-end
test asserts the field is a JSON string rather than a number, so the ordinal form cannot return
unnoticed. Breaking for the worker contract, but its only consumer today is a curl command in
testing; the cost of this change rises steeply once a tray app ships.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — what makes a remote quality measurement admissible.** VMAF is the
one thing Optimisarr will accept from a sidecar without deriving it again, so the rule for believing
it is worth stating precisely. Everything else about a returned candidate is re-checked locally
because those checks are cheap relative to the encode; VMAF is not, at roughly half the cost of
verification, so re-measuring it would give back most of the benefit of distributing the work.

The failure this guards against is not a worker that lies loudly. It is one that answers a slightly
different question — measuring a different encode, or grading itself against an easier policy — and
returns a number that looks like an answer. So evidence is refused unless it names the exact source
and candidate hashes, names the VMAF model, and was measured against thresholds at least as strict
as the library requires. Stricter is accepted: passing a harder test than the one set still passes
the one set.

The model requirement is not bookkeeping. The same file scores differently under the HD and 4K
models, so an unlabelled score cannot meaningfully be compared to a threshold at all.

Absent evidence is refused rather than read as "nothing objected", which is the difference between
failing closed and having a worker skip measuring entirely and sail through. Every objection is
reported rather than the first, for the same reason the capability matcher names them all.

Twelve tests, written before the validator and each describing a way this goes wrong rather than a
way it goes right.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — taking delivery of a candidate encoded elsewhere.** The tests were
written before the endpoint and lead with the ways it goes wrong, because the happy path is not what
loses media: a candidate encoded from a different source, a result arriving after the claim lapsed,
a truncated upload, a second result for one lease, and a delivery attempted by a worker that never
held the lease.

The order of the checks is chosen for what each one protects rather than for convenience.
Authenticate first, so nothing about a lease is revealed to a caller with no claim on it. Then prove
the claim is still held — which covers the late result and the duplicate delivery in a single check,
since a completed lease is no longer held. Then prove the candidate is about *this* source, using
the hash recorded when the source was fetched: a file encoded from different bytes is not evidence
about this job whatever its quality, and verifying one would mean judging a candidate against the
wrong original. Only after all of that is anything written to disk.

The upload is streamed and hashed in one pass under a `.partial` name, so a multi-gigabyte candidate
never sits in memory and a transfer that dies leaves nothing that could be mistaken for a finished
file. A hash mismatch deletes the staging file rather than keeping it.

An accepted candidate sets `Verifying`, deliberately not `ReadyToReplace`. Nothing has judged it
yet, and a candidate produced on another machine earns nothing until every local gate has been
repeated against it. That does mean such a job currently sits in `Verifying` with nothing to advance
it — a stalled job is the right failure while the verification slice is outstanding, where marking
it replaceable would not be.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — the sidecar can work out what it is actually capable of.** Probing
mirrors the server's `HardwareCapabilityService` rather than inventing a second approach: parse
`ffmpeg -encoders` for a cheap first pass, then confirm each hardware encoder with a real throwaway
encode to the null muxer. The distinction matters more on Apple than elsewhere, because every macOS
ffmpeg build lists VideoToolbox whether or not the machine in front of you can open it — listing
alone would have the sidecar advertise encoders that fail on first use, and a job scheduled against
a false capability can only fail. CPU encoders are trusted from the listing, as the server trusts
them.

VMAF can only ever be CPU here. Apple GPUs have no VMAF compute backend, so a test asserts the
parser can never return `Cuda` — guarding the honesty of the capability rather than the parsing.

A worker with no encoder reports zero concurrency too. Advertising capacity while advertising no
encoder would show the server a live worker it can never actually use.

ffmpeg will be bundled in the app rather than found on the system, so the worker's build matches the
server's. The roadmap already treats FFmpeg build as a scheduling criterion, and the reason becomes
concrete here: the server re-verifies a returned candidate, which only means something if the same
encode settings produce comparable output at both ends. Nothing is bundled yet — the probing reports
nothing without it, which is the correct behaviour rather than a gap to paper over.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — a worker can fetch the file it was given.** The design constraint
that shaped this route is that the worker names nothing. It presents a lease id and the server
resolves lease → job → media file → path; there is deliberately no path, filename, or library
parameter anywhere in the signature. Any of them would turn a paired sidecar into an arbitrary file
reader on the host, and no amount of validation on such a parameter is as safe as not accepting one.
Access is also bounded in time rather than only in scope: a lease that is no longer held serves
nothing, so releasing a job ends the worker's reach into the library at the same moment it gives the
work back.

Delivery is over HTTP rather than a shared mount, chosen deliberately over the cheaper option. A
shared SMB/NFS path mapping would avoid moving multi-gigabyte files across the network twice per
job, but it would also mean a sidecar that pairs with a PIN in thirty seconds then requires mount
configuration before it can do anything. Zero-config pairing that demands NFS is not zero-config.
The shared-storage path remains worth adding as an optimisation for workers that can already see the
library; it is not the thing to build first.

The source hash is computed once and stored on the job rather than per request, because re-reading
gigabytes on every resumed transfer would be its own performance bug. It exists for the slice after
this one: a returned candidate and its quality evidence have to be bound to the exact bytes that
were encoded, since a measurement taken against a different version of the file is not evidence
about this one.

Range support is not a nicety here. A worker on a home network pulling an 8 GB original will
sometimes lose the connection, and without resumption every drop costs the whole transfer again.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — leases become real, and a worker can claim a job.** The decision
that carries the safety is representing a claim as a job *status* rather than a flag or a join. A
claimed job moves from `Queued` to `Leased`, and the local dispatcher selects on `Queued`, so it
simply stops seeing the job — no query has to remember to check for a lease, and none can be added
later that forgets. The same reasoning as revocation being enforced by the credential lookup: make
the exclusion structural and it cannot be omitted at a call site.

Two holders is a database error rather than a possible outcome. A unique index over `JobId` filtered
to `State = 'Held'` means a race loses at the constraint; the claim path catches that and moves to
the next candidate instead of treating it as a failure. Lapsed leases are reclaimed at the top of
the claim path rather than by a background sweeper, so the queue heals on the next thing that would
have used it — a control plane that was down for an hour recovers on the first claim rather than
waiting for a timer.

Two SQLite constraints shaped the implementation, both already known here: `DateTimeOffset` cannot
be compared or ordered in SQL, so lease expiry filtering and the queue ordering both run in memory,
the latter over a light projection so only the shortlisted jobs are loaded with their media file.

Pairing now also stamps `LastSeenAt`. Without it a freshly paired worker read as offline until its
first heartbeat and was refused work for that window, which is wrong: pairing is itself proof we
just heard from the machine.

Adding this test class broke two unrelated setup and calibration tests, because the tokened host
fixture is shared across the collection and these tests create libraries and jobs the others count.
They now clean up after themselves. Worth recording as the second time shared-fixture state has
bitten: the first was the process-wide config directory race.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — the macOS sidecar gets a second implementation of the protocol.**
`sidecars/macos` is a Swift package rather than an `.xcodeproj`, so the build is reviewable in a
diff instead of a few thousand lines of generated XML, and the protocol client sits in its own
target with no SwiftUI or AppKit dependency — which is what lets the contract be tested without
launching a menu bar. It lives in this repository rather than its own because the client and the
contract have to change together; `web/` was already precedent for a separate toolchain here. The
`.dockerignore` gained `sidecars`, because the Dockerfile ends with a broad `COPY . .` and native
client source has no business in the Linux image.

The point of building it now, before the server can dispatch anything, is that a client written
against the published contract is the only real test of that contract. The `VmafCapability`
ordinal mistake survived several slices of server work and was caught by a question, not by a test;
a second implementation is what catches that class of error by construction. A live suite —
skipped unless pointed at a running instance — pairs, checks in, and confirms the PIN is single-use
against the real API rather than a stub.

The app claims nothing it cannot prove. It bundles no encoding tools, so it reports no encoders, no
VMAF backend, and zero concurrency, which the server reads as drained and never offers work to.
That honesty is the safety mechanism rather than a placeholder: a sidecar overstating itself would
have jobs scheduled onto it that could only fail. Revocation, protocol incompatibility, and the
feature being switched off are kept as distinct states because they need different responses — a
revoked credential is terminal and is discarded, while the feature being off is recoverable and the
credential is kept, so switching it back on does not force a re-pair.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — the lease state machine.** A lease is one worker's exclusive claim
on one job, and it exists to stop two machines encoding the same original. The instructive part is
which failure it optimises against: losing a lease merely wastes work, whereas freeing one while its
holder is still running produces two candidates racing for one source. `WorkerLease.Duration` is
therefore *derived* from `WorkerLiveness.OfflineAfter` rather than chosen independently, so the
invariant — a job can only be reclaimed after its holder was already declared unreachable — holds
structurally and not merely by convention. A test asserts the relationship as well, so neither
constant can be tuned into overlap.

Expiry is computed at read time rather than stored. A sweeper may tidy rows, but correctness must
not depend on one having run, or a control plane restarting after downtime would wake up still
believing a long-dead worker holds a job. Renewing or completing a lapsed lease is refused, which is
precisely what makes the late-result case safe: a worker that vanished, whose job moved on, cannot
deliver a candidate through a claim it no longer holds. Release is idempotent so a worker retrying
after a dropped response is not punished for being careful, and ownership is checked before state in
every operation so a stranger learns nothing about a lease it does not hold. Nothing is persisted or
dispatched yet, so no job can currently be leased.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — worker credentials finally authenticate something.** Pairing issued
a credential but nothing consumed it: `WorkerCredential.Matches` had no call site, so the secret
handed to a sidecar was inert. `POST /api/workers/heartbeat` closes that. `WorkerAuth` resolves the
worker from a bearer credential by looking it up on its stored fingerprint — the standard
stored-hash token pattern, chosen over scanning and comparing every row because the secret is 256
bits of randomness and an indexed lookup on its hash leaks nothing usable, while the alternative
would table-scan on every beat. A revoked worker's fingerprint is null and therefore matches
nothing, so revocation is enforced by the lookup itself and cannot be forgotten at a call site. An
end-to-end test pairs, beats, revokes, and proves the credential is dead afterwards; another proves
the admin token does not authenticate a worker, since the two credentials authorise different things
and accepting one for the other would let anything holding it impersonate a paired machine.

Liveness is one rule shared by the API and the UI. The 30-second interval and the 2-minute threshold
are deliberately different numbers: were they equal, a single dropped packet would flap a healthy
worker between online and offline. A test asserts the *relationship* (threshold at least three
intervals) rather than the literals, so tuning either constant cannot quietly reintroduce the flap.
Last-seen is stamped from the control plane's clock, never the request, so a sidecar with a wrong or
dishonest clock cannot claim to be alive, and the heartbeat response returns the interval so a
sidecar paces itself from the server instead of hard-coding a value that could drift out of step.

Heartbeats carry only the volatile numbers — free scratch and current concurrency. Encoders and VMAF
support stay as established at pairing, because a worker quietly changing what it claims to support
between assignments is something the control plane should re-establish deliberately rather than
absorb from a beat.

Closing a gap this slice exposed: `/api/workers/pair` and `/heartbeat` both answer 401 on bad
credentials, but the OpenAPI transformer only annotates admin-token protection, so neither
documented it. A sidecar SDK generated from the spec — exactly the audience this contract serves —
would not have known. Both routes now declare that response themselves.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — worker pairing reaches the API.** The PIN primitives below are now
wired to endpoints and storage, so a sidecar can genuinely pair. `POST /api/workers/pair` redeems a
code, negotiates the protocol, writes a `Workers` row (migration `AddWorkers`), and returns the
credential once; issue/read/withdraw, list, and revoke routes sit alongside it.

Two decisions carry the security weight. First, `/api/workers/pair` is the only worker route outside
the admin token, because a pairing sidecar holds the PIN and nothing else and cannot obtain a token.
That widening is bounded deliberately: the route is inert unless an operator has just issued a code,
it authenticates before doing any other work, and it yields nothing without the correct PIN. The
generated OpenAPI proves the boundary — every other worker operation documents a `401` and this one
does not — and both the unit and the real-host end-to-end auth tests assert it in each direction.

Second, the active PIN lives in memory and is never persisted. Writing a short-lived secret to the
config database would give it a durability it should not have and would carry it into backups;
losing it on restart is correct, because the operator simply asks for another. The service stores
the code's post-attempt state, which is what makes the cap real — `PairingCode` is immutable, so
without that every request would restart from zero failed attempts.

Redemption happens before protocol negotiation, so an incompatible sidecar spends the code rather
than probing versions repeatedly on one PIN. Enum payloads were initially integers on the claim that
this matched the rest of the API — **that was wrong, and is corrected below in the 2026-08-24 entry
on capability names**; the rest of the API converts enums to strings at the wire boundary and the
worker DTOs were the only exception. Credentials
are returned exactly once and stored only as fingerprints, so revocation clears the fingerprint and
keeps the row for the audit trail.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — PIN pairing and worker credentials for remote transcoding.**
The security primitives behind roadmap item 9's pairing bullet, as pure `Optimisarr.Core.Workers`
logic with no HTTP, persistence, or UI wiring, so no machine can pair yet. The intended flow is the
familiar one: Optimisarr displays a PIN, the operator types it into the sidecar along with this
server's URL, and the sidecar exchanges it for a credential.

The design problem is that a PIN short enough to retype by hand — eight digits — has too little
entropy to survive sustained guessing on its own. Security therefore rests on three properties
together rather than on length: the code lives five minutes, redeems exactly once, and is
**destroyed** after five wrong guesses rather than rate-limited, so the attempt budget is a
vanishing fraction of the code space and a burned code refuses even the genuine PIN. Malformed
input spends an attempt too, otherwise probing the format would be cheaper than guessing digits;
operator spacing is tolerated because people read grouped digits. A dead code (used, expired, or
burned) reports that without comparing, so nothing can be learned by racing a spent code. A
regression test asserts the attempt-budget-to-code-space ratio directly, so shortening the PIN or
raising the cap fails the suite rather than quietly weakening the argument.

Credentials are 32 random bytes, returned to the worker once and stored only as a SHA-256
fingerprint compared in constant time, matching the existing admin-token approach. A leaked
database therefore yields no usable credential, and revocation is total: an absent fingerprint
matches nothing. Endpoints, the worker table, the PIN display, assignment/lease binding, rotation,
and TLS guidance all remain to build.

**Started on dev (2026-08-24) — versioned worker protocol groundwork for remote transcoding.**
The first slice of the distributed-transcoding contract (roadmap item 9) lands as pure
`Optimisarr.Core.Workers` logic with no HTTP, persistence, or queue wiring, so no job can reach a
sidecar yet and no destructive path is touched. `WorkerProtocol.Negotiate` compares a worker's
supported version range against this build's and picks the highest both speak; a worker that is
entirely older or entirely newer, or that reports an inverted range, is refused with a reason
rather than assumed compatible, because the control plane owns the contract and a silent
assumption here is what would schedule a job onto an incompatible sidecar. `WorkerCapabilityMatcher`
decides whether an assignment may be offered at all, failing closed on encoder, hardware decoder,
VMAF mode, scratch space, and concurrency, and naming every unmet requirement rather than the first
so an operator can see why a paired sidecar sits idle. VMAF capability is ordered so a proved CUDA
backend satisfies a CPU requirement but never the reverse; a drained worker is expressed as zero
concurrency. Registration, pairing, heartbeats, leases, progress, cancellation, hashes, the
resolved-policy payload, evidence, and acknowledgement are all still to define.

**Decision (2026-08-24) — Adaptive per-title VMAF stays the default for new libraries while
Experimental.** Release 0.2.11 made the adaptive path the default for new video re-encode libraries.
The prototype-acceptance comparison the roadmap asks for — total work, selected quality, size, VMAF,
and repeatability against the fixed path — has not been recorded on any encoder family, and the
2026-08-11 Intel QSV record validates the sampled-VMAF seek-alignment correction rather than quality
targeting. The default was reviewed against that gap and deliberately kept, as a recorded exception
to the conservative-default rule in [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) §1 and
[`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md). The safety model is unchanged: the search falls back to the fixed
quality when evidence is missing or non-monotonic, and every structural, decode, duration, tail,
stream, size, and configured VMAF gate still runs before replacement. The exposure is probing time
and choice stability on newly created libraries only. The Experimental label and the acceptance
requirement both stand; removing either still needs the cross-family evidence described below.

**Experimental on dev (2026-07-27) — per-library adaptive VMAF quality path.** Video re-encode
libraries can keep the fixed preset/custom quality or explicitly opt into a bounded per-title search.
The editor presents the alternatives as radio cards with their actual processing paths and cost.
Adaptive preparation uses the production FFmpeg contract and canonical VMAF scorer over
deterministic early/middle/late windows, brackets at most four encoder-specific values, and falls
back to the fixed quality when evidence is missing or non-monotonic. Probes contain only the primary
video, and the final choice is the smallest actually encoded passing sample rather than an assumed
CRF/CQ/ICQ/QP-to-size mapping. The chosen value is job-bound for safe crash and quality-retry
recovery; it is never shared across titles. The complete output still runs every structural, decode,
duration, tail, stream, size, and configured VMAF gate before replacement. Cross-family evidence
remains required before the experimental label can be removed. Live QSV validation additionally
proved that each sample must be deleted without pruning the shared candidate workspace: the search
now retains that directory through every planned window and removes it as one unit when preparation
ends.

**Recently shipped (2026-07-25) — repeatable NVENC profile evidence.** The `dev` image includes a
guided NVIDIA quality-comparison harness created for issue #37. It prepares a dedicated folder under
`/data`, accepts exactly three short 8-bit SDR samples, and compares the current P7/CQ baseline with
isolated multipass, lookahead, spatial-AQ, and temporal-AQ variants for H.264 and HEVC. Every output
must decode and receives VMAF, size, millisecond elapsed-time, and sampled NVENC-engine and overall
GPU measurements. Hardware-rejected optional variants are capability skips with privacy-safe
diagnostics; a baseline, decode, or VMAF failure remains a real failure. The timestamped text report
omits source names and paths, the originals remain read-only, and temporary outputs are removed
unless the tester explicitly retains them. Hermetic shell tests exercise the complete report flow
without a GPU, and final-image packaging remains covered by CI.

Criz24 supplied the first physical report from a GeForce GTX 1080. Across three anonymous samples,
the advanced combinations produced no consistent quality-and-size improvement: H.264 multipass
traded a small mean-VMAF reduction for about 2.7% aggregate size reduction, spatial AQ helped one
sample but increased its size and was inconsistent elsewhere, HEVC multipass/lookahead were
effectively neutral, and HEVC temporal AQ was unavailable. That evidence closes the proposed raw
advanced-control direction without changing production encoding. The benchmark remains packaged for
future hardware generations where a materially different result could justify one tested,
capability-gated profile.

**Recently shipped (2026-07-24) — Compatibility H.264 now keeps its 8-bit promise.** Candidate
eligibility rejects an effective H.264 target when the probed source is above 8-bit, and fails closed
with re-probe guidance when bit depth cannot be confirmed. The original remains untouched and the
operator is directed to Balanced HEVC or Efficiency AV1 instead; Optimisarr neither creates poorly
supported H.264 High 10 output nor silently discards precision through a 10-to-8-bit conversion.
Custom H.264 overrides use the same guard, while the lower-level encoder and verification checks
remain defensive backstops.

Personal quality checks apply the same policy before creating disposable work: the H.264 comparison
is omitted for higher or unknown bit depths, while HEVC, AV1, and Scott's Settings remain available.
The preset description, all translated library controls, usage/setup guidance, hardware notes,
changelog, and known-issues record now state the boundary consistently. Unit, candidate-service, and
authenticated calibration endpoint coverage exercise the normal and calibration paths.

**Recently shipped (2026-07-16) — blind calibration across video, audio, and images.** Libraries can
now run a full-page quality check with one marked original reference and media-specific anonymous candidates,
without exposing candidate settings or estimated saving before every candidate is classified. Video uses three 12-second
scenes and fail-closed HDR presentation, audio uses repeatable
15-second excerpts with EBU R128 browser-side attenuation, and still images share zoom and pan
against a lossless PNG reference. Every candidate is disposable, hidden from the normal queue, and
unable to replace a source; Apply changes only the relevant saved library quality.

The live TV validation also exposed two video-reference lifecycle faults that unit-only synthetic
fixtures had missed. FFmpeg necessarily preserves packets between the previous seek point and an
input-side `-ss` when stream-copying, so a requested 12-second reference could probe as roughly 13
seconds and falsely fail Duration and Tail integrity against the accurately decoded candidate. The
fix keeps the source bitstream unchanged, limits both sides to primary video, verifies the intended
window, records the pre-roll as a blinded playback offset, and retains the reference until session
cleanup. The player uses a common accessible sample timeline rather than native controls, so raw
container pre-roll cannot shift the displayed frame. A migration persists the offset per disposable job,
while regression coverage exercises
the observed 13.054-second-reference/12-second-window case, video-only FFmpeg mapping, API slot
alignment, and the unchanged-source lifecycle.

**Recently shipped (2026-06-28) — upstream-grounded edge-case hardening.** A pass driven by real
failure modes Tdarr/Unmanic/HandBrake and ffmpeg users hit, prioritised by product risk. The design
decisions, not just the changes:

- **Dolby Vision skipped by default — the one safety fix.** DV carries a dynamic-metadata RPU that
  cannot survive a re-encode; without it the file degrades to HDR10/SDR, and a Profile 5 source (no
  HDR10 base layer) comes out green/pink. With the perceptual (VMAF) gate off by default, a DV source
  could be transcoded to a colour-shifted output and still pass verification, replacing the original —
  the kind of silent loss the safety model exists to prevent. The probe now flags DV distinctly (DOVI
  side-data or a `dvhe`/`dvh1`/`dav1` codec tag, tracked separately from `IsHdr`), and the evaluator
  skips DV regardless of the HDR setting. **Decision: a soft, reversible rule skip, not a blacklist** —
  same reasoning as the efficiency floor: a per-library `OptimiseDolbyVision` opt-in (off by default,
  in the library form, carried in config backups) re-enables it, and changing the profile makes such
  files eligible again automatically. A hard exclusion would wrongly persist past a settings change.
  Migration `AddDolbyVisionHandling`.
- **VFR timing correction after the pipeline audit.** The initial response to live job 3334 forced
  every MP4 re-encode to CFR. FFmpeg documents that CFR achieves this by duplicating and dropping
  frames, so the blanket workaround traded sync risk for cadence damage. The corrected policy stores
  positive VFR evidence from nominal-versus-average probe rates, then uses `-fps_mode vfr` with the
  demuxer encoder timebase only for those re-encodes. CFR/unknown sources receive no timing override,
  remuxes are untouched, and the relative A/V-sync, timestamp, tail, and duration gates remain the
  authority on whether an output is safe. Migration `TrackVariableFrameRate`.
- **MP4 → MKV fallback for unmuxable audio.** Copying a Blu-ray audio format MP4 has no tag for aborts
  the encode. The resolver now falls back to MKV — the same pattern as image-based subtitles — but only
  when the audio is *copied*; re-encoding it to a compatible codec keeps the MP4 target. **Decision:
  flag only the formats that genuinely abort the mux** (Dolby TrueHD, its MLP core, Blu-ray/DVD LPCM).
  DTS, AC-3, E-AC-3, AAC, Opus, and FLAC have MP4 tags and mux fine, so they are deliberately *not*
  listed — flagging them would force needless MKV fallbacks.
- **Timestamp and hardware-stream robustness.** Every video job adds `-fflags +genpts` so a source with
  missing or non-monotonic DTS muxes cleanly instead of warning/aborting — chosen because it is a no-op
  when timestamps are valid, so it is safe to apply unconditionally. And a hardware encode now drops
  data streams (camera timecode, GoPro GPMF) even for a Matroska output (previously MP4-only), since a
  hardware encoder can abort on one whatever the container — Tdarr's `-dn` fix, generalised.
- **Deliberately deferred.** A classified NVENC session-limit error and a single transient-retry of the
  encode on known-transient NVENC/QSV errors were left out: both are speculative without the hardware to
  reproduce against, and the session-limit case is low risk while the concurrency default is 1. Recorded
  in the roadmap so the decision is visible rather than silently dropped.

**Recently shipped (2026-06-26).**

- **Already-efficient source skip: done.** A video already encoded at a very low bitrate for its
  resolution (e.g. a ~1.6 Mbps 1080p h264 episode) is skipped at eligibility instead of being
  transcoded and then rejected by the size-saving gate. Uses a per-profile efficiency floor in bits
  per pixel-second (resolution/frame-rate independent), calibrated against real library data; HEVC and
  H.264 set a floor, AV1 sets none. Conservative (uses total-file bitrate), with the size-saving gate
  still the backstop. A per-library **"Skip already-efficient sources"** toggle (Libraries → video
  settings, on by default, migration `AddLibrarySkipEfficientSources`, carried in settings backups)
  lets an operator disable the floor for a library and send every eligible file to the encoder.
- **Already-optimised sibling skip: done.** When an Optimisarr-produced output (a marked re-container,
  e.g. an hevc `.mp4`) still sits beside its original (e.g. the h264 `.mkv`), the original is now
  skipped at eligibility ("An optimised copy already exists alongside this file") instead of being
  transcoded again only to collide at replacement time. Detected purely from the probed inventory
  (same library, same path stem, marked sibling) via the pure `OptimisedSiblingEvaluator` overlay.
- **Permanently blocked auto-replace no longer loops: done.** A `ReadyToReplace` job that can never be
  applied (destination occupied by a different optimised file, verified output gone, or original gone)
  is now failed once rather than retried every reconcile cycle. Because it becomes terminally failed,
  the "previously failed" overlay and auto-exclusion then stop the file being re-queued.
- **MP4 container compatibility fix: done.** A re-encode/remux to an MP4-family output now drops
  Matroska attachment (`-0:t`) and data (`-0:d`) streams, which MP4 cannot mux. Previously a source
  carrying a font/cover attachment (reported by ffmpeg as "codec none in stream #N") aborted the whole
  job before a frame was written; the original was always left untouched, but the file never optimised.

- **Preview clip mode: done.** Long video previews encode a 60-second segment from the middle of the
  source, verify against a temporary clipped reference from that same window, and label the compare
  report as segment-only so VMAF/loudness/duration/size checks are interpreted correctly.
- **Dry-run mode: done.** A global Settings → General → Replacement switch lets operators scan,
  queue, transcode, verify, and preview normally while blocking manual replacement,
  auto-replace, and quarantine purge. Verified outputs stop at Ready to replace for
  review; rollback remains available for existing replacements because it restores
  the protected original.
- **Migration smoke test: done.** The test suite now applies all EF migrations to an empty
  SQLite database and asserts no pending migrations remain, catching broken migration chains
  separately from the `EnsureCreated`-based unit tests.
- **Release docs hardening: done.** The quickstart now covers compose selection, writable
  mounts, readiness checks, dry-run-first operation, and authenticated reverse-proxy exposure.
  Troubleshooting covers dry-run replacement blocks, readiness failures, config import
  validation, and stale UI after updates; security notes now call out the administrative
  surface and secret-bearing exports explicitly.
- **Synthetic-media integration coverage: done for candidate flow.** Hermetic tests now
  create synthetic video, audio, and image files, scan them through the real inventory
  service, apply synthetic ffprobe JSON through the parser, and verify candidate decisions
  through the real candidate service.
- **GHCR publishing: done.** CI builds the production container, runs the container
  readiness smoke test, and publishes GHCR images on non-PR branch/tag builds. The
  workflow builds that production image once, smoke-tests it, then pushes the same tags
  to avoid spending CI time on duplicate Docker builds.

- **Media thumbnails in lists: done.** Every row on the Inventory page and the per-library Candidates
  tab shows a kind-appropriate thumbnail: **film/TV** a poster (Radarr/Sonarr first — an exact, local
  match keyed to the imported file, with TV rows showing the series poster — then a connected media
  server); **music** the file's embedded cover art (extracted with ffmpeg, no external service);
  **images** a down-scaled still of the image itself. All bytes are produced/proxied by the backend so
  no token reaches the browser, lazy-loaded into a fixed box with a silent placeholder fallback.
  Reusable `<Thumbnail>` component + `GET /api/media/{id}/thumbnail`. Beyond the original roadmap scope.
- **Custom preset stop: done.** The per-library video slider ends in a **Custom** stop, so a manual
  codec/container choice is a deliberate "Custom" configuration rather than an amber "Overridden"
  warning (advances Phase 12's "richer, explicit preset sliders").
- **Inventory reconciliation: done.** A scan now prunes inventory rows whose file has vanished (e.g. a
  Radarr/Sonarr upgrade-and-rename), cascading their now-meaningless jobs, while preserving rows with
  replacement history — so an upgraded title no longer leaves a phantom candidate and a job that fails
  with "No such file". A job whose source disappears now fails fast with a clear reason.
- **Replacement safety hardened.** Fixed a concurrency race where the post-verify auto-replace and the
  background reconcile sweep could replace the same job at once and destroy the verified output (the
  original was always preserved). Replacement is now serialised per job, and a ReadyToReplace job
  whose verified output has vanished is failed rather than retried forever.

**Inventory master-detail refactor: done.** Inventory uses a bounded, paged file list with a
per-file detail card beneath it (probe values, eligibility reason, and actions).

**Queue operational UI: done.** Queue has a top-of-page current-work hero card
with stage, progress, encoder, speed, ETA, and live CPU/GPU telemetry. Queue and
Quarantine use the same bottom-sheet detail interaction as Inventory, shrinking
their tables while the selected report is open instead of expanding a row inline.

**Inventory & Candidates unified: done.** The separate Candidates page is gone — the **Inventory**
page now shows every file's stream detail alongside its eligibility (Eligible / Skipped / Not probed
+ reason), with an eligibility filter, so the file list and "what the rules select" are one view.
The Libraries workspace keeps its own per-library Candidates tab (that's the per-library focus; this
is the fleet-wide list). `#/candidates` redirects to Inventory.

**Explicit video preset sliders: done.** Every position on the per-library video slider now shows
the codec it resolves to, and the complete codec/container/CRF/HDR/video-audio/downmix bundle is
driven by the backend's `RuleProfileDefaults` (served via `/api/library-options`) rather than a
hard-coded UI map. The editor, normal queue, anonymous quality candidates, and applied quality-check
result therefore share one preset definition. A first extra preset position is shipped —
**"Scott's Settings"** (`RuleProfile.ScottsSettings`): HEVC/MP4 with HDR tone-mapped to SDR and audio
re-encoded to AAC 96 kbps stereo. The global tone-map engine setting chooses compatible software or
supported hardware. Adding further positions remains optional future work.

**Re-encode oversized same-codec files: done.** A per-library option re-encodes files already in
the target codec when they exceed a configurable size (default 20 GB), to shrink large same-codec
remuxes; the size-saving gate still protects the original.

**File exclusions: done.** Individual files can be excluded from optimisation — manually (e.g. from a
stuck Queue job) or automatically after three failures — via a durable, path-keyed list, managed on
a per-library **Excluded** tab. This replaces relying on the soft "previously failed" skip, which was
lost when queue history was cleared.

**Dashboard outcomes: done.** The Dashboard leads with a persistent lifetime **space-saved** total
(resettable, surviving restarts and history clearing), the work in flight, and live CPU/GPU usage
while a job encodes.

**Quarantine compare-to-approve: core done.** The Quarantine page now expands each replacement into
a compare panel (original vs replacement size/saving + the full verification report), with
**Approve & free space** (purge the original now) and **Reject (roll back)** actions. Visual media
preview (thumbnails/players) is deferred. See the Phase 11 note.

**Phase 12 (Unified Library & Candidates workspace): core done.** Opening a library now shows its
rules and the candidates those rules select as two tabs in one view, with re-resolve on save and
per-library eligible/skipped tallies on the list. The all-libraries candidate list now lives on the
unified **Inventory** page (see the Inventory & Candidates note above), not a separate Candidates page.
See the Phase 12 section for the remaining optional polish.

## Current status (2026-06-26)

- **Phase 0 (Foundation): done.** Repo, three .NET projects + Svelte UI, Docker
  image building and publishing to GHCR via CI, health endpoint, SQLite under
  `/config` via EF Core migrations.
- **Phase 1 (Discovery & Inventory): done, extended.** Recursive settling-aware
  scanning, ffprobe inspection, inventory UI. Extended beyond the original plan
  to support **multiple libraries**, each with its own media type and rule
  profile, plus a folder-picker for paths. **Scans now reconcile deletions:** a row
  whose file has vanished from disk (e.g. a Sonarr/Radarr upgrade renamed it) is
  pruned — cascading its jobs, preserving rows with replacement history — so the
  inventory matches reality and stale candidates/jobs don't linger.
- **Phase 2 (Candidate Rules): largely done.** A pure, unit-tested
  `CandidateEvaluator` turns per-library rule profiles into eligibility
  decisions with a human-readable reason for every file (eligible or skipped):
  min size, resolution limit, HDR/Dolby Vision exclusion, path exclusions,
  codec/container matching, and already-processed detection. Surfaced via
  `GET /api/candidates`, shown as the eligibility column on the Inventory page (and as a
  per-library Candidates tab in the Libraries workspace). Per-library overrides (target
  codec/container, HDR handling, size/resolution limits, path exclusions,
  priority) are editable from expandable cards on the Libraries page and resolved
  by a pure `RuleResolver`. **Already-processed detection** now also covers prior
  jobs: a file optimised (or failed) for its current version is held back by a pure
  `OptimisationHistoryEvaluator` so the queue never loops on it, and a genuinely
  changed file becomes eligible again. Still to come: a measured minimum-saving
  estimate (today's proxy is "already in the target codec").
- **Phase 3 (Queue and Worker): done.** A `Job` state machine, a pure
  `JobScheduler` (priority-then-FIFO, global `maxConcurrentJobs`), a pure
  `FfmpegCommandBuilder`/`TranscodeSpecResolver`, and a single-writer
  `QueueDispatcher` background worker that runs ffmpeg out-of-process with
  cancellation and crash recovery. Live progress is pushed to the SignalR client
  in the Queue UI: a determinate bar with encode speed and ETA while
  transcoding (parsed by a pure, unit-tested `FfmpegProgressParser`) and an
  indeterminate sweep for the probing/verifying phases. Enqueue from a library's
  eligible candidates; manage from the Queue page. Outputs land in `/work` as
  `ReadyToReplace` — originals are never touched. **Queue detail view:** clicking a
  job opens a slide-up sheet (the shared `BottomSheet`, also used by Inventory) with a
  large progress bar, fps/speed/ETA, the resolved encoder (GPU/CPU), output size, the
  verification report, and inline replace/retry/cancel — plus a **live CPU/GPU usage
  graph** while it encodes (see Phase 7). The **sidebar** Queue item shows a throbbing
  GPU chip for hardware-accelerated work or a snail for CPU work, with a running-job
  count, driven by one app-wide SignalR connection.
- **Phase 4 (Verification): done.** A clean ffmpeg exit no longer trusts the
  output. The worker runs a real `Verifying` step — a full-decode health check
  (`DecodeHealthCheck`), an output ffprobe, and a comparison against the original —
  and feeds the evidence to a pure, unit-tested `VerificationEvaluator`. The
  `VerificationReport` (decode health, output readable, video stream present,
  duration tolerance, audio/subtitle retention, size saving) is persisted on the
  job and surfaced on the Queue page. Only a passing report advances toward
  replacement; a failure marks the job `Failed` with the output retained for
  inspection and the original untouched. Thresholds are fixed conservative
  defaults for now (`VerificationPolicy.Default`). Queue filters surface all,
  verified, and verification-failed jobs; selecting a row opens its full gate
  report in the shared detail sheet.
- **Phase 5 (Safe Replacement and Rollback): done.** A verified `ReadyToReplace`
  job can replace its original — the original is quarantined under `/trash` first,
  then the verified output is moved into place, with a recorded `Replacement` as
  the rollback path. Moves are atomic on one filesystem and fall back to a verified
  copy-plus-delete across mounts (reported in the UI). A final-path integrity check
  and re-probe follow; the job moves to `Completed`. Rollback restores the original
  and removes the replacement. Pure `ReplacementPlanner` and the replace/rollback
  service are unit tested; originals are retained in quarantine until the
  configurable retention window (Phase 6) expires.
  Surfaced via the Queue **Replace** action and the new **Quarantine** page.
  **Hardened (2026-06-26):** replacement is serialised per job, closing a race where
  the post-verify auto-replace and the reconcile sweep could act on one job at once
  and destroy the verified output (the original was always preserved); and a
  `ReadyToReplace` job whose verified output has vanished is now failed rather than
  retried indefinitely.
- **Phase 6 (Scheduling and Resource Controls): in progress.** Processing
  windows, global max concurrent jobs, CPU thread limits, and disk-space safety
  pause are wired into queue dispatch/FFmpeg arguments and surfaced in
  Settings/Queue. Running jobs are never interrupted; the gates only decide
  whether new jobs may start. Hardware capability detection for FFmpeg
  accelerators and encoders is surfaced on Tools, and global encoder mode
  selection is wired into generated FFmpeg arguments. Verification policy is
  configurable per library with media-aware controls. Replacement/quarantine policy is now configurable —
  cross-filesystem fallback is opt-in and a background worker enforces the
  quarantine retention window, purging originals (and dropping their rollback path)
  once it expires. Optional **service-activity pauses** are done too: configurable
  Plex/Jellyfin/Emby watchers hold new jobs while a server is streaming, decided by
  a pure, unit-tested evaluator that ignores unreachable servers so one offline
  server never wedges the queue. Phase 6 is now feature-complete. **Per-library
  automatic optimisation** extends this: a library has its own local-time window
  (pure `AutoEnqueueScheduleEvaluator`), and inside that window its eligible files
  are continuously queued **and** dispatched; outside it, that library's jobs do not
  start. There is no longer a global processing window — global settings hold only
  the library scan interval, and manually queued jobs run whenever the queue can
  start one (subject to concurrency, activity-pause, and disk-safety). A dedicated
  **Schedule page** surfaces dispatch status (ready/paused + reason, running/limit,
  free work-disk) and the per-library auto-optimise table with each library's window,
  in/out-of-window state (overnight windows handled), auto-replace setting, and last run.
- **Phase 7 (GPU Support): largely done.** Encoder/hwaccel capability detection on Tools,
  global encoder-mode selection wired into FFmpeg args, and jobs that fail fast with a clear
  reason when a selected encoder is unavailable. **NVENC is now confirmed working end-to-end**
  (an earlier bug silently ran video re-encodes on CPU when a file was classified `Unknown`; the
  encoder is now resolved whenever the spec re-encodes video, and the command builder emits
  per-encoder rate control — NVENC `-cq`, QSV `-global_quality`, VAAPI `-qp` — instead of `-crf`
  for all). Transcoding runs through **jellyfin-ffmpeg** (bundles the Intel iHD driver + oneVPL and
  NVENC), and the compose example documents `/dev/dri` + the render group, so **Intel QSV/VA-API
  (e.g. an N100) and AMD VA-API** are wired — pending on-hardware validation (see the
  [hardware validation matrix](../setup/hardware-validation-matrix.md)).
  Encoder availability is now **confirmed by a real test encode** per encoder (cached, with a Tools
  Refresh to re-probe) rather than inferred from device-node presence, so the capability list reflects
  what actually works. **Intel QSV is now validated on real hardware** — hardware *encode* and
  *decode* both confirmed on an Intel iGPU host (CPU dropped from ~142% to ~22% on a 4K encode with
  the render/video engines busy). **GPU hardware decoding** is wired and on by default
  (`queue.hardwareDecode`): when a hardware encoder is in use the source is decoded on the GPU
  (`-hwaccel` + `-hwaccel_output_format`, no `hwupload`). HDR→SDR uses software by default; an
  opt-in QSV/VA-API VPP path freshly confirms non-Dolby-Vision HDR10/PQ before keeping supported
  work on GPU surfaces; HLG, Dolby Vision, unknown metadata, disposable comparisons, and VMAF-gated
  jobs retain their like-for-like software path. Recognised hardware setup failures retry once with
  software decode and tone mapping. **Live, unprivileged CPU/GPU
  metrics** stream to the Queue graph over SignalR — `/proc/stat` for CPU and per-process DRM fdinfo
  (Intel/AMD) → AMD sysfs → `nvidia-smi` for GPU, with no root/CAP_PERFMON or compose change required.
  Portable Fast/Balanced/Efficient encoder effort now resolves onto the selected x264/x265,
  SVT-AV1, NVENC, or QSV vocabulary at dispatch; VAAPI keeps its driver default, and invalid legacy
  or API values fail before FFmpeg. NVIDIA normal transcodes now use the documented NVDEC/CUDA
  path when Hardware decoding is enabled, with the same software-decode fallback. Physical decoder
  utilisation was confirmed on 2026-07-24, while the full NVIDIA evidence bundle and CUDA VMAF run
  remain pending. Remaining: AMD VA-API and complete NVIDIA/QSV validation evidence.
- **Phase 8 (Library Integration): feature-complete.** Authenticated Plex (OAuth/PIN),
  Jellyfin (Quick Connect/API key), and Emby (API key) connections; targeted re-scan after a
  replacement/rollback; Sonarr/Radarr import-aware exclusions; notifications (webhook/ntfy/
  Apprise); config-and-secrets backup/import.
- **Phase 9 (Gold-Standard Verification): feature-complete.** Per-library, opt-in VMAF gate;
  always-on HDR/colour/A-V-sync/timestamp/tail integrity gates; audio channel/sample-rate
  retention; and opt-in EBU R128 loudness plus true-peak clipping gates. All gate logic is pure and
  unit tested. Legacy PSNR/SSIM report fields remain nullable; current video perceptual gating uses
  VMAF only.
- **Phase 10 (Multi-Media Optimisation): feature-complete.** Media-kind detection;
  lossless-audio optimisation with per-library audio codec/bitrate; **audio-codec selection for
  video transcodes** (AAC default); **stereo downmix** across both pipelines; **any-source
  (lossy) audio re-encoding** gated on a proven bitrate saving; and **media-type-scoped library
  Advanced options**; and sane default per-container profiles. **Image optimisation (WebP) works
  end-to-end**: candidate rules, command building, kind-aware verification, per-library overrides,
  a `Photo` media type, animated-image skipping, and the UI — verified in a container (still
  PNG/BMP/TIFF → WebP with large savings, dimensions retained, verification passing). **Image
  optimisation is now broadly complete:** proven output formats on a compatibility→efficiency slider
  (**JPEG** default for max compatibility incl. Plex and **WebP** for modern clients), per-library
  **downscaling** (named 4K/1080p caps, custom max long-edge, or percentage —
  aspect-preserving, never upscaling, with a downscale-aware Dimensions gate), a default-on **image
  SSIM quality gate**, and a **portable optimisation marker** for every image format via exiftool
  (EXIF/XMP `Software`), closing the marker round-trip gap, a default-on **EXIF/ICC-retention gate**
  (an image that drops the original's ICC colour profile or EXIF on re-encode fails verification;
  reads both with exiftool, fails closed, flags loss only), and the **output-filename collision fix**
  (work output is namespaced per media file, and a replacement whose destination is already occupied
  fails safely). The final-container smoke suite validates the production JPEG and WebP
  encoder/quality mappings, metadata round trips, structural probes, and decodes.

- Candidate preview UI.
- Per-file "why eligible" and "why skipped" explanation.

Exit criteria:

- The app can show a safe optimisation candidate list without running FFmpeg.
- Every skipped file has a human-readable reason.

## Phase 3: Queue and Worker

Goal: transcode one file at a time reliably, with visible progress.

Deliverables:

- Job table and state machine:
  - queued
  - probing
  - transcoding
  - verifying
  - ready_to_replace
  - completed
  - failed
  - cancelled
- Background worker based on ASP.NET Core `BackgroundService`.
- FFmpeg command builder.
- Process cancellation.

- Job detail page with logs and generated command.

Exit criteria:

- A user can enqueue a file and produce an output in `/work`.
- Progress updates stream live to the UI.
- Cancelling a job stops FFmpeg and marks the job cancelled.

## Phase 4: Verification

Goal: prove converted media is healthy before replacement is even possible.

Deliverables:

- Output ffprobe.
- Full decode health check with FFmpeg.
- Duration tolerance check.
- Stream policy comparison:
  - required video stream exists
  - required audio streams retained or intentionally converted
  - required subtitle streams retained or intentionally converted
  - chapters and metadata policy recorded
- Size saving check.
- Verification report model.
- UI verification report.

Exit criteria:

- Jobs cannot enter replacement flow unless verification passes.
- Failed verification leaves original untouched and output retained for review
  or deleted according to settings.

## Phase 5: Safe Replacement and Rollback

Goal: replace originals safely and reversibly.

Deliverables:

- Quarantine layout under `/trash`.
- Replacement transaction record.
- Atomic move path where source/output/trash are on one filesystem.
- Copy-plus-verify fallback when mounts prevent atomic moves.
- Final-path probe after replacement.
- Rollback action.
- Retention policy for quarantined originals.
- UI for quarantine and rollback.

Exit criteria:

- A verified output can replace an original.
- The original can be restored from quarantine.
- Cross-filesystem replacement is detected and reported clearly.

## Phase 6: Scheduling and Resource Controls

Goal: make the app safe to run continuously on a home server.

Deliverables:

- Time windows. **Done** (now per-library auto-optimise windows; the global processing window was removed).
- Max concurrent jobs, initially defaulting to 1. **Done.**
- CPU thread limits. **Done.**
- GPU/CPU worker mode selection. **Done.**
- Pause while disk free space is below threshold. **Done.**
- Pause while configured services are active (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby). **Done.**
- Per-library priority. **Done.**
- Configurable verification policy. **Done.**

Exit criteria:

- A user can restrict processing to overnight windows.
- The app stops queueing work when disk space is unsafe.

## Phase 7: GPU Support

Goal: make hardware encoding discoverable, explicit, and testable.

Deliverables:

- Encoder capability detection: **Done** (FFmpeg hwaccels, known encoder
  availability, NVIDIA runtime, `/dev/dri` mapping surfaced on Tools).
  - CPU x264/x265
  - NVIDIA NVENC
  - Intel QSV
  - VAAPI
  - AV1 where available
- UI hardware status page.
- Compose examples:
  - NVIDIA GPU reservation
  - `/dev/dri` Intel/AMD mapping
- Portable encoder effort with quality/speed notes: **Done.** Fast/Balanced/Efficient resolves onto
  valid x264/x265, SVT-AV1, NVENC, or QSV presets after encoder selection; VAAPI uses its driver
  default, and save/import/dispatch share the same validation policy.
- Startup warnings when selected GPU mode is unavailable. **Done for jobs** (jobs
  fail before FFmpeg starts with a clear unavailable-encoder reason).

Exit criteria:

- The app can detect available encoders and prevent invalid preset selection. **Done.**
- A GPU-enabled compose example is documented and tested.

## Phase 8: Library Integration

Goal: fit cleanly into existing media stacks without becoming a second media
manager.

Status: started. A verified replacement (and a rollback) now triggers a
best-effort re-scan on connected Plex/Jellyfin/Emby servers, reusing the Phase 6
activity-pause connections (per-watcher "refresh after replacements" toggle, pure
unit-tested `LibraryRefreshRequestBuilder`). Token acquisition is now interactive
too: **Plex OAuth/PIN** and **Jellyfin Quick Connect** sign-in flows fill in the
token instead of the user pasting a raw one (Emby keeps a manual API key).
**Notifications** are done: webhook/ntfy/Apprise targets fire best-effort on
replacement and failure, with pure unit-tested message/request builders.
**Import/export** is done too: a secret-bearing config snapshot (settings, libraries,
watchers, notification targets, Sonarr/Radarr connections) exports to JSON and
imports back as a validated, non-destructive merge (pure unit-tested
`ConfigSnapshotValidator`). The file must be stored securely; it intentionally
does not include jobs, replacements, quarantine, or rollback history.
**Sonarr/Radarr import-aware exclusions** are done as
well: connected managers are polled for in-progress imports and any file whose
folder an import is landing in is held back from queueing (pure unit-tested
`ArrQueueParser` and `ArrImportExclusionEvaluator`), so Optimisarr never fights an
import. Phase 8 is now feature-complete.

Deliverables:

- **Authenticated media-server connections** so Optimisarr can tell the server to
  re-scan a title after a verified replacement (a replaced file keeps its path but
  changes container/codec/size, so the server should re-read it). Each provider's
  login is different and must use the provider's own supported flow — Optimisarr
  never asks the user to paste a raw password for storage:
  - **Plex — OAuth/PIN flow.** Create a PIN (`POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins`
    with `X-Plex-Product` and a stable `X-Plex-Client-Identifier`), send the user
    to `https://app.plex.tv/auth#?clientID=…&code=…&forwardUrl=…`, then poll
    `GET https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins/{id}?code=…` until `authToken` is present.
    Store that token and call the server with `X-Plex-Token`. Refresh a section
    with `GET /library/sections/{id}/refresh` — and prefer a **targeted** refresh
    of just the changed file via `?path=<dir>` so a replacement doesn't trigger a
    full library scan.
  - **Jellyfin — Quick Connect (preferred) or an admin API key.** Quick Connect:
    initiate a code, the user approves it from a signed-in Jellyfin session, then
    poll until it yields an access token; alternatively accept an admin-issued API
    key. Authenticate with `Authorization: MediaBrowser Token=<token>`. Trigger a
    rescan via the "Scan Media Library" scheduled task
    (`POST /ScheduledTasks/Running/{taskId}`) or notify a specific path with
    `POST /Library/Media/Updated` (`Path` + `UpdateType`).
  - **Emby — admin API key (its Connect login is account-owned).** Same
    MediaBrowser lineage as Jellyfin: authenticate with `X-Emby-Token` / the
    `api_key` query / `Authorization: MediaBrowser Token=`, refresh with
    `POST /Library/Refresh`, or notify a path with `POST /Library/Media/Updated`.
  - Tokens/keys are stored as provider connections (encrypted at rest), validated
    on save, and **reusable by the Phase 6 activity-pause watchers** so a user
    configures each server once. A connection that fails auth is surfaced, not
    silently ignored.
- **Trigger a targeted refresh after each successful replacement** (and on
  rollback), best-effort and never blocking or undoing the replacement if the
  server is unreachable.
- Optional Sonarr/Radarr path-aware exclusions. **Done.**
- Optional notifications (Apprise, ntfy, webhook). **Done.**
- Import/export settings. **Done.**

Exit criteria:

- A user can connect Plex (via OAuth/PIN), Jellyfin (via Quick Connect or API
  key), and Emby (via API key), and Optimisarr validates each connection.
- A verified replacement triggers a targeted re-scan of just the changed title on
  every connected server, and a server being offline never affects the
  replacement's safety.
- Integrations remain optional and disabled by default.

## Phase 9: Gold-Standard Health Verification

Goal: raise verification from "the output decodes and roughly matches" to a
defensible, evidence-backed guarantee that the converted file is as good as it
needs to be — so replacing an original is a decision the user can fully trust.
This deepens Phase 4 rather than replacing it; every existing gate stays.

Status: feature-complete. Video re-encodes can be scored against the original with an opt-in,
fail-closed `libvmaf` gate using harmonic-mean, fifth-percentile, and catastrophic-frame floors.
The image bundles a dedicated libvmaf-enabled static FFmpeg so the gate can run without disturbing
the transcode path. Always-on
gates cover **HDR preservation** (an HDR original whose library preserves HDR must keep
its HDR10/HDR10+/HLG/Dolby Vision signal, while an intentional tone-map to SDR passes),
**colour primaries/transfer/matrix** preservation, **A/V sync**, **monotonic decode
timestamps**, **audio channel/sample-rate retention**, and full-file **decode-error
counting**; an opt-in **EBU R128 loudness** gate, an opt-in **true-peak clipping** gate
(sharing the loudness decode pass), and **per-library VMAF threshold overrides** round it
out. **Truncated/partial-last-GOP detection** (the output's latest presentation time
falling materially short of the source runtime, sharing the monotonicity probe) closes the
last container-integrity item. All gate logic is pure and unit tested.

Deliverables:

- **Perceptual/structural quality scoring** of the output against the original: VMAF with automatic
  model selection, computed by FFmpeg's `libvmaf` filter and parsed by a pure, unit-tested evaluator.
  A configurable per-library policy blocks replacement when quality drops too far. **Done:**
  harmonic-mean, fifth-percentile, and catastrophic-frame floors; automatic HDTV/UHD model
  selection; deterministic stream alignment; and HDR-to-SDR reference preparation are implemented
  and exercised in final-container CI. The older incidental PSNR/SSIM report fields remain nullable
  and are no longer requested during video scoring.
- **Per-frame decode integrity**, not just a single full-decode pass: count and
  surface decoder errors/corrupt frames, dropped/duplicated frames, and any
  packet-level read errors over the whole file.
- **Container and stream integrity**: A/V sync drift within tolerance, monotonic
  timestamps, no truncated/partial last GOP, correct frame count within
  tolerance, and color metadata (primaries/transfer/matrix, HDR10/HDR10+/Dolby
  Vision side data) preserved or intentionally transformed. **HDR signal
  preservation, colour primaries/transfer/matrix preservation, A/V-sync,
  monotonic decode-timestamp, and truncated/partial-last-GOP checks done.**
- **Audio fidelity checks** appropriate to the operation: channel layout and
  sample-rate retention, loudness (EBU R128) drift within tolerance, and no
  clipping introduced. **Channel/sample-rate retention, EBU R128 loudness drift, and
  true-peak clipping detection done** (pure unit-tested parsers/evaluators).
- **Per-rule-profile thresholds** so an "archive" profile can demand near-lossless
  scores while a "space-saver" profile accepts more, all surfaced in the
  `VerificationReport` with the measured numbers, not just pass/fail. **Done** via
  per-library VMAF threshold overrides resolved by a pure `VerificationPolicyResolver`.

Exit criteria:

- A passing report includes measured quality scores (e.g. VMAF) and integrity
  counts, and a configurable quality gate can fail a job that decodes cleanly but
  looks materially worse than the original.
- All scoring logic is pure and unit tested against captured FFmpeg output; no
  live FFmpeg in tests.

## Phase 10: Multi-Media Optimisation (Video, Audio, Images)

Goal: extend the same safe pipeline — candidate rules, transcode, gold-standard
verification, quarantine/rollback — from video to **audio-only files and
images**, so a library of music or photos benefits from the same guarantees.

Status: feature-complete. **Media-kind detection, audio and image optimisation, per-library rules,
channel-aware codec/bitrate selection, metadata verification, and media-type-scoped Advanced
options are done.** A pure, unit-tested `MediaKindClassifier` classifies every probed file as
video, audio, or image (cover-art-aware, so an album-art picture never makes an audio file
look like video), stored on `MediaFile.MediaKind` and surfaced as a Kind column in the
Inventory. Lossless audio is re-encoded through the full pipeline — candidate rules,
transcode (cover art + metadata + the same optimisation marker as video, so audio files are
never re-optimised either), kind-aware verification, and the usual reversible replacement.
Each library can override the audio target codec (Opus/AAC/MP3), stereo bitrate baseline, image
target (JPEG/WebP), quality, and downscale policy.

Deliverables:

- **Media-kind detection** in scanning/probe so each file is classified as video,
  audio, or image, with kind-specific inventory columns. **Done.**
- **Audio optimisation**: target codec/bitrate/sample-rate rules (e.g. lossless →
  efficient lossy or re-pack), with verification on loudness, channel layout,
  duration, and decode health. Tag/metadata and embedded-art preservation. **Done**
  (lossless → configurable codec/bitrate, compatibility-first AAC 128 kbps default;
  outputs carry the optimisation marker like video). Attached-art counts and source tags are
  replacement gates. Opus sources with attached pictures are rejected because FFmpeg cannot
  translate an attached video stream into Ogg's picture-comment representation safely.
- **Transcode from any audio source, not just lossless.** A per-library "re-encode lossy audio"
  opt-in now also makes already-lossy sources eligible, but only when re-encoding would
  genuinely save space: probing records the source audio bitrate, and a lossy file is eligible
  only when that bitrate exceeds the target by a safety margin (≥25%, `AudioTarget.LossyReencodeSaves`).
  A file at/near the target, or one whose bitrate ffprobe could not report, is left untouched
  with a clear reason. The conservative lossless-only behaviour stays the default. **Done.**
- **Audio codec selection for video transcodes.** A video re-encode used to copy its audio
  tracks untouched (`-c:a copy`). A per-library option now also transcodes the audio of a
  video to a chosen codec/bitrate (AAC — the broadly compatible default — Opus, or MP3),
  reusing the audio-target encoder mapping so the audio rules are shared between audio-only
  jobs and video jobs. Compatibility H.264/HEVC profiles default to channel-aware AAC so their MP4
  playback promise covers the whole file; AV1/MKV and remux profiles copy, and every profile offers
  an explicit Copy override. The audio-fidelity gate understands an intentional re-encode and allows sample-rate
  normalisation while still catching a silent downmix or a dropped rate on a copied track.
  **Done.**
- **Stereo downmix (channel reduction) across the audio *and* video pipelines.** A
  per-library option now downmixes multichannel audio (e.g. 5.1 → 2.0 stereo) on re-encode,
  applied both to audio-only jobs and to the re-encoded audio tracks of a video transcode (it
  pairs with the audio-codec selection above; a copied track keeps its layout). The
  verification audio-fidelity gate treats a requested downmix as intentional (not a silent
  channel loss), while an unrequested downmix or a total loss of audio still fails. Saves space
  where surround is not needed; defaults to off. **Done.**
- **Well-researched, sane default profiles per container/use-case.** Each profile now ships a
  matched container + visually-transparent CRF (researched against 2026 device/codec support):
  **Conservative HEVC → MP4 + AAC, CRF 24** for broad device/Apple/TV compatibility;
  **Compatibility H.264 → MP4 + AAC, CRF 20** for older clients; **Experimental AV1 → MKV + Opus,
  CRF 30** for maximum efficiency; Remux/Cleanup unchanged. A new profile-level `DefaultCrf`
  replaces the encoder's arbitrary built-in default; per-library overrides still layer on top.
  The two MP4 compatibility profiles now use channel-aware AAC by default so their playback promise
  covers the whole file; Advanced retains an explicit Copy override, with no implicit downmix.
  AV1/MKV and remux profiles continue to copy audio. The preset is now picked via a simple compatibility↔efficiency
  **slider** (with a separate "no re-encode" toggle for Remux/Cleanup), keeping every exact knob
  behind Advanced options. **Done.**
- **Image optimisation: done.** JPEG and WebP form the selectable
  compatibility-to-efficiency range with validated quality mappings and configurable,
  aspect-preserving downscaling. Candidate rules fail closed on unknown animation/multipage state,
  alpha loss, high-bit-depth loss, and unapproved lossless-to-lossy conversion. Replacement requires
  decode/readability, intended dimensions, size saving, default-on SSIM, and EXIF/ICC retention;
  ExifTool copies safe metadata and writes the portable optimisation marker that FFmpeg's still
  encoders cannot retain themselves. Container CI encodes, probes, metadata-checks, and decodes all
  production targets, including lossless RGBA WebP comparison. AVIF was withdrawn after final-image
  testing proved the production Jellyfin FFmpeg does not ship an AVIF encoder; persisted AVIF
  overrides migrate safely to WebP.
- **Per-kind rule profiles and encoder settings**, reusing the existing
  per-library override model. **Audio target codec/bitrate, video audio codec/bitrate, and
  stereo downmix, image target/quality/downscale, and loss-policy controls done.**
- **Scope the library Advanced-options UI to the library's media type.** The form now shows
  only the controls that apply to the library's `MediaType` — video settings (codec/container,
  CRF, encoder preset, max resolution, HDR handling, VMAF, and the video-audio codec/bitrate)
  for Film/TV, audio settings (audio target codec/bitrate) for Music — while a mixed "Other"
  library still shows everything and the stereo-downmix toggle stays visible for every type
  (it applies wherever audio is re-encoded). Purely a UI refinement; the underlying per-library
  overrides are unchanged. **Done.**
- Pure, unit-tested resolvers/evaluators per kind; the worker dispatches by media
  kind to the right command builder and verifier. **Done.**

Exit criteria:

- A user can point a library at music or photos, see kind-appropriate candidates,
  and run optimise → verify → replace with rollback, never losing an original.
- Image/audio verification gates block replacement on quality or metadata loss.

## Phase 11: Settings Preview and Compare

Status: core done, clip follow-up done. A **Preview** action on each eligible candidate (Inventory and the Libraries
workspace) queues a throwaway `Preview` job — the real probe→transcode→verify pipeline on one file
with the library's resolved settings — that never moves or replaces anything, writes to its own
`/work/preview/<id>` scratch, is hidden from the queue, is deleted on close, and never survives a
restart. The compare panel shows the original next to the encoded result with a per-media-type
viewer (image/video/audio, range-streamed), a size/codec/resolution/audio stats table with the %
size saving, and the full Phase 9 verification report. Long video previews use a 60-second sample
from the middle; VMAF seeks and decodes the full original at that exact sample start, rather than
judging against a stream-copied clip that may retain pre-roll from the preceding keyframe, so
segment-only scores stay meaningful. Deferred: apply-from-preview (settings are already saved, so
previewing then enqueuing already works). The Quarantine compare-to-approve half was delivered
earlier.

Goal: let a user *try* a library's configured settings on a real file and see the
result before committing — a temporary, throwaway optimisation shown side by side
with the original, with hard numbers, so tuning settings is empirical instead of
guesswork.

Deliverables:

- **One-off preview job**: optimise a chosen file (or a representative sample/clip
  to keep it fast) into a temporary location using the library's resolved
  settings, never touching the original and never entering the replace flow;
  auto-cleaned afterwards.
- **Side-by-side compare UI**: original vs optimised players in sync (or matched
  frame thumbnails), plus a statistics panel — file size and % change, bitrate,
  codec/container, resolution, audio layout, the VMAF result when enabled, and the verification
  summary.
- **Clip mode: done.** Video previews encode a 60-second middle segment for fast turnaround, verify
  against the same segment of the original, and label scores as segment-only.
- **Apply-from-preview**: if happy, the same settings are already saved; the
  preview output is discarded and the real queue run uses them.
- Pure helpers for the comparison statistics; the temporary-job lifecycle reuses
  the existing worker with a "preview" job type that is exempt from replacement.
- **Quarantine compare-to-approve (related, on the Quarantine page). Core done.** Each replacement
  on the Quarantine page expands into a compare panel showing the quarantined original against the
  in-place replacement — size + saving % and the full Phase 9 verification report (VMAF when
  enabled, duration, audio-retention, and other gates) — so an operator can **approve** (here: delete
  the quarantined original now to reclaim space, keeping the replacement) or **reject** (roll back to
  the original) from one screen. Reuses the existing rollback and quarantine-purge services — a
  review UI over actions that already exist, never a new destructive path. The **visual** half
  (in-sync players / matched-frame thumbnails) is deferred; today's compare is stats + report only,
  since the original's pre-replacement probe isn't persisted.

Exit criteria:

- A user can preview settings on a file, watch original vs optimised side by side,
  read the size/quality deltas, and decide — with the original guaranteed
  untouched and the preview artifact cleaned up.
- From the Quarantine page, a user can compare a replaced file against its quarantined
  original and approve or roll back, with the safety model unchanged.

## Phase 12: Unified Library & Candidates Workspace

Status: core done. Opening a library is now a tabbed workspace — a **Rules** tab (the existing
preset + Advanced form) and a **Candidates** tab showing the eligible/skipped decisions for *that*
library, reusing the shared `CandidateTable` component. The candidate list **re-resolves on Save**
(and after Scan/Enqueue) so it always reflects the persisted rules, and the editor stays open after
Save so the cause-and-effect loop happens in one place. The **Libraries list** shows each library's
eligible/skipped **tally** (a lightweight `/api/candidates/summary` that reuses the pure
`CandidateEvaluator`), and the all-libraries candidate list now lives as the eligibility column on
the unified **Inventory** page (the separate Candidates page was merged into Inventory). No new
domain logic; enqueue remains the only action and only queues. Remaining optional polish: optimistic
live preview of *unsaved* edits (folds into Phase 11).

Goal: stop treating a library's *configuration* and the *files that configuration
selects* as two separate screens. Today the **Libraries** page edits a library's
rules and the **Candidates** page (filtered by a library dropdown) shows the
resulting eligible/skipped decisions — but they are the two halves of one mental
loop: *change a rule → see what it now selects → enqueue it*. Splitting that loop
across two pages means the operator tunes a setting on one screen, navigates to
another, re-selects the same library, and reads the effect with no memory of what
changed. Bringing them together makes the cause-and-effect immediate and is the
natural home for the Phase 11 settings preview.

This is a UX consolidation, not new domain logic; it can land independently of the
phase numbering and reuses the existing `/api/libraries` and `/api/candidates`
endpoints. It must be done *thoughtfully* — combining the views badly (one giant
scrolling page, or burying the candidate list behind the rule form) would be worse
than leaving them apart.

Deliverables:

- **A per-library workspace** (a library opens into its own view) that shows, in
  one place: the library's identity and simple choice (name/path/type + the
  compatibility↔efficiency preset) up top, its **Advanced options** still gated and
  collapsed, and — alongside, not buried beneath — the **candidate list for that
  library** with the same eligible/skipped reasons shown on the Inventory page.
- **Live cause-and-effect**: editing a rule re-resolves the candidate decisions for
  that library (eligible/skipped counts and reasons update) so the operator sees
  what a change selects *before* committing it. Decisions come from the existing
  pure `CandidateEvaluator`, so this is a re-fetch/re-render, not new logic.
- **A summary still reachable across libraries**: keep a way to see candidates (or
  at least eligible counts) for *all* libraries at once, so the per-library focus
  does not lose the fleet-wide view — the Libraries list shows each library's
  eligible/skipped tally, and the all-libraries view lives on the unified Inventory page.
- **Richer, explicit preset sliders.** Give the per-library **video** slider more
  positions/options (e.g. a finer compatibility→efficiency axis, and surfacing more of
  the per-codec choices that currently live only in Advanced) and make every slider
  **explicit about what it selects** — show the exact codec/container/CRF (video) or
  format/quality (image) each position resolves to, so the slider is never a black box.
  The "Selects: …" badges under the video/image sliders are the first cut; extend this to
  cover every position and keep it accurate against the backend `RuleProfileDefaults`.
- **Honest, unchanged safety semantics**: enqueue still only queues; nothing here
  replaces or deletes. The workspace must not imply a rule change retroactively
  un-optimises already-processed files.
- A clear migration for the navigation: the sidebar's separate "Libraries" and
  "Candidates" entries are reconsidered together (one "Libraries" workspace, with
  candidates as a tab/panel within it) rather than left as two peers that overlap.

Open questions to resolve during design (not pre-decided here):

- Whether the candidate list lives as a **tab** within the library view, a **side
  panel**, or an expandable section under each library card.
- How live the re-resolve should be: on **save** (simplest, honest) vs. an
  optimistic **preview** of unsaved edits (more powerful, closer to Phase 11, but
  must never be mistaken for the persisted state).
- Where the **all-libraries** candidate overview ultimately belongs (its own page,
  the Dashboard, or a roll-up on the Libraries list).

Exit criteria:

- An operator can open one library, adjust its rules, and see the eligible/skipped
  candidate list for that library update in the same place, then enqueue — without
  hopping between two screens and re-selecting the library.
- The fleet-wide candidate/eligibility overview is still reachable.
- No change weakens or misrepresents the safety model; enqueue remains the only
  action and it only queues.

## Phase 13: Release Hardening

Goal: make the first public image safe for real libraries.

Deliverables:

- Dry-run mode. **Done.**
- Backup/export of SQLite config. **Done for portable config-and-secrets snapshots; raw
  SQLite state backup remains external/operator-owned.**
- Database migrations tested. **Done for empty-database migration smoke coverage.**
- Integration tests with synthetic media fixtures. **Done for scan → parsed probe → candidates across video, audio, and images.**
- Docker image published to GHCR. **Done via CI after container readiness smoke.**
- README quickstart. **Done.**
- Troubleshooting guide. **Done.**
- Security notes around mounted volumes and reverse proxies. **Done.**

Exit criteria:

- A careful user can run Optimisarr against a real library with dry-run,
  verification, quarantine, and rollback available.

## First implementation slice

The first working slice should be deliberately small:

1. Scaffold .NET API, Svelte UI, Dockerfile, and compose example.
2. Add `/api/health`.
3. Add `/api/system/tools` to report FFmpeg and ffprobe availability.
4. Add one library root setting.
5. Scan a directory and store file paths.
6. Probe one selected file and show streams in the UI.

This provides an end-to-end app shape before adding transcoding or
replacement behaviour.
